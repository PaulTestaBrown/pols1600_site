# {{< fa lightbulb >}} Probability {.inverse}

## Probability

- Probability describes the [likelihood of an event]{.blue} happening.

- Statistics uses probability to [quantify uncertainty]{.blue} about estimates and hypotheses.

- To do this, we will need to understand:

  - Definitions ([**experiment**, **sample space**, **events**]{.blue})

  - Three *rules* of probability ([**Kolmogorov axioms**]{.blue})

  - Two interpretations interpreting probabilities ([**Frequentist**]{.blue} and [**Bayesian**]{.blue})



## Experiments, sample spaces, sets, and events {.smaller}

- In probability theory, an [**experiment**]{.blue} describes a repeatable process where the outcome is uncertain

  - Processes where the outcomes are uncertain are called [*non-deterministic*]{.blue} or [*stochastic*]{.blue}

- The [**sample space**]{.blue} of an experiment is the **set** $(\Omega$ "omega", or $S$) of [all the possible outcomes]{.blue} of an experiment

## Experiments, sample spaces, sets, and events {.smaller}

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width=60%}
- Sets can be:

  - empty $( A: \{\emptyset\})$
  - a single event $( Coin: \{\text{Heads}\})$
  - multiple events $( Odd\, \#s: \{\text{1,3,5}\})$
  - infinite $(\mathbb{R}: \text{ The set of real numbers}\{ -\infty \dots +\infty\}$)

- An **event**, $(E$ or $A)$ is a **subset** of outcomes in the sample space

  - The sample space for a coin flip is $\Omega = \{\text{Heads, Tails}\}$
  - The event Heads is a subset of $\Omega$

:::

::::

## Subsets {.smaller}

- Subset: Let $D$ be the set outcomes for a 6-side die: $D=\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$
  - $Primes=\{2,3,5\}$
  - $Primes \subset D \iff \forall X \in Primes, X \in D$

## Unions, Intersections, and Complements {.smaller}

- Unions
  - $A \cup B = \{X:X \in A \lor X \in B \}$
  - Either $A$, $B$ or both $A$ and $B$ occur
- Intersections
  - $A \cap B = \{X:X \in A \land X \in B \}$
  - Both $A$ and $B$ occur
- Complements
  - $A'=A^\complement = \{X:X\notin A\}$
  - $A'=A^\complement$ means $A$ does not occur
  - $\emptyset^\complement=S$ and $S^\complement=\emptyset$

## Three Rules of Probability{.smaller}

:::{.nonincremental}

- Probability is defined by three *rules* or assumptions called the [**Kolmogorov Axioms**](https://win-vector.com/2020/09/19/kolmogorovs-axioms-of-probability-even-smarter-than-you-have-been-told/)

1. [Positivity:]{.blue} The probability of any event $A$ is [nonnegative]{.blue}

$$Pr(A) \geq 0 $$

2. [Certainty:]{.blue} The probability that [one of the outcomes]{.blue} in the sample space [occurs]{.blue} is 1

$$Pr(\Omega) = 1 $$

3.  [Additivity:]{.blue} If events $A$ and $B$ are [mutually exclusive]{.blue}, then:

$$Pr(A \text{ or } B) = Pr(A) + Pr(B)$$ 

:::

## The Addition Rule

For events, $A$ and $B$, the **addition** rule says we can find the probability of either $A$ or $B$ occurring:

$$Pr(A \cup B) = Pr(A \text{ or } B) = Pr(A) + Pr(B) - \underbrace{Pr(A \text{ and } B)}_{\text{aka } Pr(A \cap B)}$$ 

In words: The probability of either A or B occurring is the probability that A occurs plus the probability that B occurs - minus the probability that both occur (so that we're not double counting...)

[Source](https://www.onlinemathlearning.com/union-set.html)

## The Law of Total Probability (Part 1)

For any event two events, $A$ and $B$, the probability of $A$ $(Pr(A))$ can be **decomposed** into the sum of the probabilities of two **mutually exclusive** events:

$$Pr(A) = Pr(A \text{ and } B) + Pr(A \text{ and } B^{\complement})$$

## Two interpretations of probablity

- Probabilities are defined by these three axioms

- The are two broad ways of interpreting what probabilities mean:

  - [Frequentist]{.blue}

  - [Bayesian]{.blue}

## Frequentist interpretations of probability {.smaller}

:::{.nonincremental}

- Probability describes how likely it is that some event happens.

  - Flip a fair coin, the probability of heads is Pr(Heads) = 0.5


- **Frequentist:** view this probability as the [limit of the relative frequency]{.blue} of an event [over repeated trials]{.blue}.

$$Pr(E) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{n_{E}}{n} \approx \frac{ \text{# of Times E happened}}{\text{Total # of Trials}}$$

- Thinking about probability as a relative frequency, requires us to [know how to count](https://bookdown.org/probability/beta/counting.html) the number of times an event occurred ([see also](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/54bf3241e4b0f0d81bf7ff36/t/55e9494fe4b011aed10e48e5/1441352015658/probability_cheatsheet.pdf))

:::

## Frequentist interpretations of probability

- Probabilities from a Frequentist perspective are defined by *fixed* and *unknown* **parameters**

- The goal of statistics for a frequentist is to learn about these parameters from data.

- Frequentist statistics often ask questions like "What is the probability of observing some data $Y$, given a hypothesis about the true value of parameter(s), $\theta$, that generated it.

## Frequentist interpretations of probability {.smaller}

For example, suppose we wanted to test whether a coin is "fair" $(p = Pr(Heads) = .5; q = Pr(Tails) = 1-p = .5).$ We could:

- Flip a fair coin 10 times. Our estimate of the $Pr(H)$ is the number of heads divided by 10. It could be 0.5, but also 0 or 1, or some number in between.

- Flip a coin 100 times and our estimate will be closer to the true $paramter$.

- Flip a coin an $\infty$ amount of times and the relative frequency will converge to the true parameter $(Pr(H) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{n_{H}}{n} = p = 0.5 \text{ for a fair coin})$

## Bayesian interpretations of probability {.smaller}



- Frequentist interpretations make sense for describing processes that we could easily repeat (e.g. Coin flips, Surveys, Experiments)


- But feel more convoluted when trying to describe events like "the probability of that Biden wins reelection."


- Bayesian interpretations of probability view probabilities as [subjective beliefs]{.blue}.


- The task for a Bayesian statistics is to update these [*prior* beliefs ]{.blue} () based on a model of the [*likelihood*]{.blue} of observing some data to form new beliefs after observing the data (called the [*posterior beliefs*]{.blue}).



## Bayesian Updating

:::{.nonincremental}

- Bayesians update their beliefs according to  *Bayes Rule*, which says:

$$\text{posterior} \propto \text{likelihood} \times \text{prior}$$ More formally:

$$\underbrace{Pr(\theta|Y)}_{\text{Posterior}} \propto \underbrace{Pr(Y|\theta)}_{\text{Likelihood}}) \times \underbrace{Pr(\theta)}_{\text{Prior}}$$

## Bayesian vs Frequentists

:::{.nonincremental}

Our two main tools for doing statistical inference in this course

- Hypothesis Testing
- Interval Estimation

Follow largely from frequentist interpretations of probability

:::

## Bayesian vs Frequentists {.smaller}

:::{.nonincremental}

The differences between Bayesian and Frequentist frameworks, are both philosophical and technical in nature

- Is probability a relative frequency or subjective belief? How do we form and use prior beliefs

- Bayesian statistics relies heavily on algorhithms for [Markov Chain Monte-Carlo](http://www.columbia.edu/~mh2078/MonteCarlo/MCMC_Bayes.pdf) simulations made possible by advances in computing.


For most of the questions in this course, these two frameworks will yield similar (even identical) conclusions.

- Sometimes it's helpful to think like a Bayesian, others, like a frequentist
:::

## Summary: Probability{.smaller}

- Probability is a measure of uncertainty telling us how likely an event (or events) is (are) to occur

- Probabilities are:

  - Non-negative
  - Unitary
  - Additive

- Two different interpretations of probability:

  - Frequentists: Probability is a long run relative frequency
  - Bayesians: Probability reflect subjective beliefs which we update upon observing data



# {{<fa lighbulb>}} Conditional Probability{.inverse}

## Conditional Probability: Definition{.smaller}

The conditional probability that event **A** occurred, given that event **B** occurred is written as $Pr(A|B)$ (*"The probability of A given B"*) and defined as:

$$Pr(A|B) = \frac{Pr(A \cap B)}{Pr(B)} = \frac{\text{Probability of Both A and B}}{\text{Probability of B}}$$

- $Pr(A \cap B)$ is the same as $Pr(A \text{ and } B)$ is the **joint probability** of both events occurring

- $Pr(B)$ is the **marginal probability** of B occuring

## Conditional Probability: Multiplication Rule {.smaller}

Joint probabilities are **symmetrical**. $Pr(A \cap B) = Pr(B \cap A)$.

By rearranging terms:

$$Pr(A|B) = \frac{Pr(A \cap B)}{Pr(B)}$$ We get the **multiplication rule**:

$$Pr(A \cap B) = Pr(A|B)Pr(B) = Pr(B|A)Pr(A)$$ 

## The Law of Total Probability (Part 2)

We can use multiplication rule to derive an alternative form of the law of total probability:

$$Pr(A) = Pr(A|B)Pr(B) + Pr(A|B^\complement)Pr(B^\complement)$$

## Independence

Events $A$ and $B$ are independent if

$$Pr(A|B) = Pr(A) \text{ and } Pr(B|A) = Pr(B)$$

Conceputally, If $A$ and $B$ are **independent** knowing whether $B$ occurred, tells us nothing about $A$, and so the conditional probability of $A$ given $B$, $Pr(A|B)$ is equal to the unconditional, or marginal probability, $Pr(A)$

## Independence

Formally, two events are statistically independent if and only if the joint probability is equal to product of the marginal probabilities

$$Pr(A\text{ and }B) = Pr(A)Pr(B)$$

## Conditional Independence

We can extend the concept of independence to situations with more than two events:

If events $A$, $B$, and $C$ are jointly independent then:

$$Pr(A \cap B \cap C) = Pr(A)Pr(B)Pr(C)$$

Joint independence implies pairwise independence and conditional independence:

$$Pr(A \cap B | C) = Pr(A|C)Pr(B|C)$$ But not the reverse.

## Bayes Rule {.smaller}

:::{.nonincremental}
Bayes rule is theorem for how we should update our beliefs about $A$ given that $B$ occurred:

$$Pr(A|B) = \frac{Pr(B|A)Pr(A)}{Pr(B)} = \frac{Pr(B|A)Pr(A)}{Pr(B|A)Pr(A)+Pr(B|A^\complement)Pr(A^\complement)}$$ Where

- $Pr(A)$ is called the prior probability of A (our initial belief)

- $Pr(A|B)$ is called the posterior probability of A given B (our updated belief after observing B)

## What's the probability you have Covid-19 given a positive test

$$Pr(Covid|Test +) = \frac{Pr(+|Covid)Pr(Covid)}{Pr(Test +)}$$

## Possible Outcomes

Four possible outcomes

```{r}
#| echo: false

covid_tab <- tibble(
  Test = c("Positive","Negative"),
  `Have Covid` = c("True Positive","False Negative"),
  `Don't Have Covid` = c("False Positive","True Negative")
)
  
kable(covid_tab)
```


## What's the probability you have Covid-19 given a positive test {.smaller}

:::{.nonincremental}

Let's assume:

- 1 out 100 people have Covid-19

- Our test correctly identifies true positives 95 percent of the time ([sensitivity = True Positive Rate]{.blue})

- Our test correctly identifies true negatives 95 percent of the time ([specificity = True Negative Rate]{.blue})

In a sample of 100,000 people then:

```{r}
#| echo: false

covid_tab <- tibble(
  Test = c("Positive","Negative"),
  `Have Covid` = c(950,50),
  `Don't Have Covid` = c(4950,94050)
)
  
kable(covid_tab)
```

:::

## What's the probability you have Covid-19 given a positive test {.smaller}

:::{.nonincremental}

Now we can calculate the relevant quantities for:

$$Pr(Covid|Test +) = \frac{Pr(+|Covid)Pr(Covid)}{Pr(Test +)}$$

- $Pr(+|Covid) = 950/(1000) \approx 0.95$\
- $Pr(Covid) = 1000/100000 \approx 0.01$\
- $Pr(+) = Pr(+|Covid) + Pr(+|Covid)= .95*.01 + .05*.99 \approx 0.059$

Which yields:

$$Pr(Covid|Test +) = \frac{Pr(+|Covid)Pr(Covid)}{Pr(Test +)} = \frac{0.95 \times 0.01}{0.059} \approx 0.16$$ 
:::

## What if you took a second test?{.smaller}

We could use our [updated posterior belief]{.blue} as our [new prior]{.blue}:

$$Pr(Covid|2nd +) = \frac{0.95 \times 0.16}{0.16\times0.95 + (1-0.16)\times 0.95 } \approx 0.783$$ 

Now we're much more confident that we have Covid-19



# {{<fa lightbulb>}} Random Variables and Probability Distributions {.inverse}

## Random Variables 

- [Random variables]{.blue} assign [numeric values]{.blue} to each event in an experiment.

  - Mutually exclusive and exhaustive, together cover the entire sample space.

- [Discrete random]{.blue} variables take on finite, or [countably infinite](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CountablyInfinite.html) distinct values.

- [Continuous variables]{.blue} can take on an uncountably infinite number of values.

## Example: Toss Two Coins

- $S={TT,TH,HT,HH}$
- Let $X$ be the number of heads
  - $X(TT)=0$
  - $X(TH)=1$
  - $X(HT)=1$
  - $X(HH)=2$

## Probability Distributions{.smaller}

Broadly probability distributions provide mathematical descriptions of random variables in terms of the probabilities of events.

The can be represented in terms of:

- [Probability Mass/Density Functions]{.blue}
  - [Discrete variables]{.blue} have probability mass functions (PMF)
  - [Continuous variables]{.blue} have probability density functions (PDF)
- [Cumulative Density Functions]{.blue}
  - Discrete: Summation of discrete probabilities
  - Continuous: Integration over a range of values

## Discrete distributions

- **Probability Mass Function (pmf):** $f(x)=p(X=x)$

- Assigns probabilities to each unique event such that Kolmogorov Axioms (Positivity, Certainty, and Additivity) still apply

- **Cumulative Distribution Function (cdf)** $F(x_j)=p(X\leq x)=\sum_{i=1}^{j}p(x_i)$

  - Sum of the probability mass for events less than or equal to $x_j$

## Example: Toss Two coins{.smaller}

- $S={TT,TH,HT,HH}$
- Let $X$ be the number of heads
  - $X(TT)=0$
  - $X(TH)=1$
  - $X(HT)=1$
  - $X(HH)=2$
- $f(X=0)=p(X=0)=1/4$
- $f(X=1)=p(X=1)=1/2$
- $F(X\leq 1) = p(X \leq 1)= 3/4$

## Rolling a die

```{r}
#| echo: false

df <- data.frame(x=seq(0, 7), 
                 y=c(0,cumsum(rep(1,6)/6),1),
                 p=c(NA,rep(1,6)/6,NA))
df$xend <- c(df$x[2:nrow(df)], NA)
df$yend <- df$y

p.pmf <- ggplot(df, aes(x=x, y=p)) +
      geom_segment(aes(xend = x, yend = 0), size = 1)+geom_point()+
    ylim(0,1)+labs(title="PMF of Die")+xlim(0,7)
#p.pmf
p.cdf <- ggplot(df, aes(x=x, y=y, xend=xend, yend=yend)) +
      geom_vline(aes(xintercept=x), linetype=2, color="grey") +
      geom_point() +  # Solid points to left
      geom_point(aes(x=xend, y=y), shape=1) +  # Open points to right
      geom_segment()+  # Horizontal line segments
    ylim(0,1)+labs(title="CDF of Die")+xlim(0,7)
ggarrange(p.pmf,p.cdf)

```

Each side has equal probability of occurring (1/6). The probability that you roll a 2 or less P(X\<=2) = 1/6 + 1/6 = 1/3

## Continuous distributions {.smaller}

- **Probability Density Functions (PDF):** $f(x)$
  - Assigns probabilities to events in the sample space such that Kolmogorov Axioms still apply
  - But... since their are an infinite number of values a continuous variable could take, p(X=x)=0, that is, the probability that X takes any one specific value is 0.
- **Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)** $F(x)=p(X\leq x)=\int_{-\infty}^{x}f(x)dx$
  - Instead of summing up to a specific value (discrete) we integrate over all possible values up to $x$
  - Probability of having a value less than x

## Integrals{.smaller}

What's the area of the rectangle? 

:::{.fragment}
$base\times height$


```{r}
#| echo: false

df<-data.frame(x=c(0,1),y=c(1,1))

p.rect<-ggplot(data.frame(x1=0,x2=1,y0=0,y1=1),
               aes(xmin=x1,xmax=x2,ymin=y0,ymax=y1)
               )+geom_rect(col="black",fill="black",alpha=.2)+xlim(-.5,1.5)+ylim(0,1.5)
p.rect
```

:::

## Integrals

How would we find the area under a curve?

```{r}
#| echo: false

x<-rnorm(1000000)
plot(density(x),xlab="",ylab="",main="")
```

## Integrals

Well suppose we added up the areas of a bunch of rectangles roughly whose height's approximated the height of the curve?

```{r}
#| echo: false

hist(x,freq=F,xlab="",ylab="",main="")
lines(density(x))
```

Can we do any better?

## Integrals

Let's make the rectangles smaller

```{r}
#| echo: false

hist(x,freq=F,xlab="",ylab="",main="",breaks=100)
lines(density(x))
```

What happens as the width of rectangles get even smaller, approaches 0? Our approximation get's even better

## Link between PDF and CDF{.smaller}

If $$F(x)=p(X\leq x)=\int_{-\infty}^{x}f(x)dx $$

Then by the [fundamental theorem of calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_calculus)

$$\frac{d}{dx}F(x)=f(x)$$

In words

- the PDF $(f(x))$is the derivative (rate of change) of the CDF $(F(X))$

- the CDF describes the area under the curve defined by f(x) up to x

## Properties of the CDF

- $0\leq F(x) \leq 1$

- $F$ is non-decreasing and right continuous

- $\lim_{x\to-\infty}F(x)=0$

- $\lim_{x\to\infty}F(x)=1$

- For all $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$ s.t. $a<b$

:::{.fragment}

$$p(a < X \leq b) = F(b)- F(a) = \int_a^b f(x)dx $$

:::

## Recall the PMF and CDF of a die

```{r}
#| echo: false

ggarrange(p.pmf,p.cdf)
```

## What's the probability

- $p(X=1)...p(X=6) = 1/6$

- $p( 2 < X \leq 5) = F(5)-F(2)=5/6-2/6=3/6=1/2$

## What we'll use proability distributions for:

In this course, we'll use probability distributions to

- Model the [data generating process]{.blue} as a function of parameters we can estimate

- To perform [statitical inference]{.blue} based on asymptotic theory (statements about how statistics would be have as our sample size approached infinity)

# {{<fa lightbulb >}} Expected Values and Variances{.inverse}

## Expected Value

A (probability) weighted average of the possible outcomes of a random variable, often labeled $\mu$

Discrete:

$$\mu_X=E(X)=\sum xp(x)$$

Continuous

$$\mu_X=E(X)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}xf(x) dx$$

## Condtional Expectations:

For a continuous variable:

$$
E(X|Y=y) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}xf_{x|y}(x|y) dx
$$

Where:

$$
f_{x|y}(x|y) = \frac{f_{x,y}(x,y)}{f_y(y)} = \frac{\text{Joint distribution of X and Y}}{\text{Marginal distribution of Y}}
$$

Which follows from the law of total probability

## What's the expected value of one roll of fair die?

$$\begin{align*}
E(X)&=\sum_{i=1}^{6}x_ip(x_i)\\
     &=1/6\times(1+2+3+4+5+6)\\
     &= 21/6\\
     &=3.5
\end{align*}$$

## Properties of Expected Values

- $E(c)=c$

- $E(a+bX)=a+bE[X]$

- $E[E[X]]=X$

- $E[E[Y|X]]=E[Y]$

- $E[g(X)]=\int_{-\infty}^\infty g(x)f(x)dx$

- $E[g(X_1)+\dots+g(X_n)]=E[g(X_1)]+\dots E[g(X_n)$

- $E[XY]=E[X]E[Y]$ if $X$ and $Y$ are independent

#### How many times would you have to roll a fair die to get all six sides? 

- We can think of this as the sum of the expected values for a series of geometric distributions with varying probabilities of success, $p$. The expected value of a geometric variable is:

:::{.fragment}

$$\begin{align*}E(X)&=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}kp(1-p)^{k-1} \\
&=p\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}k(1-p)^{k-1} \\
&=p\left(-\frac{d}{dp}\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}(1-p)^k\right) \text{(Chain rule)} \\
&=p\left(-\frac{d}{dp}\frac{1-p}{p}\right) \text{(Geometric Series)} \\
&=p\left(\frac{d}{dp}\left(1-\frac{1}{p}\right)\right)=p\left(\frac{1}{p^2}\right)=\frac1p\end{align*}$$
:::

## Rolling a fair die to get all six sides{.smaller}

For this question, we need to calculate the probability of success, p, after getting a side we need.

The probability of getting a side you need on your first role is 1. The probability of getting a side you need on the second role, is 5/6 and so the expected number of roles is 6/5, and so the expected number of rolls to get all six is:

```{r}
ev <- c()
for(i in 6:1){
  ev[i] <- 6/i
  
}
# Expected rolls for each 1 through 6th side
rev(ev)
# Total 
sum(ev)
```

## Variance

If $X$ has a finite mean $E[X]=\mu$, then $E[(X-\mu)^2]$ is finite and called the [variance of $X$]{.blue} which we write as $\sigma^2$ or $Var[X]$.


## Variance{.smaller}

$$\begin{align*}
\sigma^2=E[(X-\mu)^2]&=E[(X^2-2\mu X+\mu^2)]\\
&= E[X^2]-2\mu E[X]+\mu^2\\
&= E[X^2]-2\mu^2+\mu^2\\
&= E[X^2]-\mu^2\\
&= E[X^2]-E[X]^2
\end{align*}$$

- "The variance of X is equal to the expected value of X-squared, minus the square of X's expected value."
- $\sigma^2=E[X^2]-E[X]^2$ is a useful identity in proofs and derivations

## Standard Deviations

A standard deviation is just the square root of the variance

$$\sigma_{X}=\sqrt{Var[X]}$$

Standard deviations are useful for describing:

- A typical deviation from the mean/Expected value
- The width or spread of a distribution



## Covariance and correlation{.smaller}

:::{.nonincremental}

Covariance measures the degree to which two random variables vary together.

- $Cov[X,Y] \to +$ An increase in $X$ tends to be larger than its mean when $Y$ is larger than its mean

$$Cov[X,Y]=E[(X-E[X])(Y-E[Y])]=E[XY]-E[X]E[Y]$$

- The correlation between $X$ and $Y$ is simply the covariance of $X$ and $Y$ divided by the standard deviation of each.

$$\rho=\frac{Cov[X,Y]}{\sigma_X\sigma_Y}$$

- Normalized covariance to a scale that runs between $[-1,1]$

:::


## Properties of Variance and Covariance

- $Cov[X,Y]=E[XY]-E[X]E[Y]$

- $Var[X]=E[X^2]-(E[X])^2$

- $Var[X|Y]=E[X^2|Y]-(E[X|Y])^2$

- $Cov[X,Y]=Cov[X,E[Y|X]]$

- $Var[X+Y]=Var[X]+Var[Y]+2Cov[X,Y]$

- $Var[Y]=Var[E[Y|X]]+E[Var[Y|X]]$

## What you need to know (WYNK)

Honestly, for this class, you won't need to know these properties. 

They'll show up in proofs and theorems and become important when you're trying to evaluate properties of an estimator (isn't unbiased, is it "efficient", or consistent does it have minimum variance?) but that's for another day/course.



## Summary: Random Variables and Probability Distributions{.smaller}

- [Random variables]{.blue} assign numeric values to each event in an experiment.

- [Probability distributions]{.blue} assign probabilities to the values that a random variable can take.

  - Discrete distributions are described by their pmf and cdf
  - Continuous distributions by their pdf and cdf

## Summary: Random Variables and Probability Distributions{.smaller}

- Probability distributions let us [*describe the data generating process*]{.blue} and encode information about the world into our models

  - There are lots of distributions
  - Don't worry about memorizing formulas
  - Do develop intuitions about the nature of your data generating process (Is my outcome continuous or disrecte, binary or count, etc.)

- Two key features of probability distributions are their:

  - [Expected values]{.blue} probability weighted averages
  - [Variances]{.blue} which quantify variation around expected values


# {{< fa lightbulb >}} Standard Errors for Regression{ background-image="https://www.phrases.org.uk/images/cart-before-the-horse.jpg" background-size="contain" background-opacity=.2}

## Interpreting regressions

- Regression coefficients $(\beta)$ are crucial for [substantive interpretations]{.blue} (sign and size)

- The [standard errors]{.blue} of these coefficients $(SE(\beta))$ are the key to evaluating the [statistical significance]{.blue} of these coefficients

## What's a standard error? {.smaller}

- The [standard error]{.blue} of an estimate is the [standard deviation]{.blue} of the theoretical [sampling distribution]{.blue} 

- A sampling distribution is a distribution of the estimates we would observe in  [repeated sampling]{.blue}

  - Example: Re-run the 1978 CPS, we get different respondents, and thus different estimates.
  
- [Standard errors]{.blue} describe the width of the sampling distribution 
  - How much our estimates might vary from the true (population) value from sample to sample.

- [Standard errors]{.blue} can be used to construct intervals and conduct tests that [quantify our uncertainty]{.blue} about our estimate

## {.smaller}
#### Standard errors of regression coefficients 

For a linear regression written in matrix notation:

$$
y = X\beta + \epsilon
$$

 OLS yields estimates of $\beta$, $\hat{\beta}$ by minimizing the sum of squared residuals

$$
\hat{\beta} = (X'X)^{-1}X'y
$$

## {.smaller}
#### Standard errors of regression coefficients 

[One can show](https://web.stanford.edu/~mrosenfe/soc_meth_proj3/matrix_OLS_NYU_notes.pdf) under a [set of assumptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression#Assumptions) that variance-covariance matrix of $\hat{\beta}$ is

$$
\begin{aligned}
E[(\hat{\beta} -\beta)(\hat{\beta} -\beta)'] &= \sigma^2(X'X)^{-1}\\
& = \begin{bmatrix}
Var(\hat\beta_0) & Cov(\hat{\beta_0},\hat{\beta_1}) & \cdots & Cov(\hat{\beta_0},\hat{\beta_k}))\\
Cov(\hat\beta_1,\hat{\beta_0}) & Var(\hat{\beta_1},) & \cdots & Cov(\hat{\beta_1},\hat{\beta_k}))\\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
Cov(\hat\beta_k,\hat{\beta_0}) & Cov(\hat{\beta_k},\hat{\beta_1}) & \cdots & Var(\hat{\beta_k})\\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{aligned}
$$
Where we can estimate $\sigma^2$ with $\hat{\sigma}^2$ the mean $(1/n-k)$ squared error $(\epsilon'\epsilon)$ of the regression

$$
\hat{\sigma}^2 = \frac{\epsilon'\epsilon}{n-k}
$$



## {.smaller}
#### Standard errors of regression coefficients

The standard error for the $k$th coefficient $\beta_k$ is simply the square root of the of the $k$th diagnoal element of the [variance-covariance matrix]{.blue}

$$
\text{SE}(\beta_k) = \sqrt{Var(\beta_k)}
$$

## Robust Standard Errors{.smaller}

$\sigma^2(X'X)^{-1}$ is a good estimate of the variance of $\hat{\beta}$ if the errors in a regression are [independent]{.blue} and [identically distributed]{.blue} (iid).

These turn out to be [strong assumptions]{.blue} that are violated when there is:

- [Non-constant error variance]{.blue} (aka heteroskedasticity)
  - The variance among the treated units tends to be higher than the variance among control units
- [Autocorrelation]{.blue}
  - We observe the [same unit]{.blue} over [multiple periods]{.blue} (Say RI in 2016, 2018, 2020)
- [Clustering]{.blue}
  - Respondents in RI are more similar to each other than respondents in MA

## Robust Standard Errors{.smaller}


- [Robust standard errors]{.blue} are ways of [calculating standard errors]{.blue} for regressions when we think the assumption of [IID errors]{.blue} is unrealistic

  - The assumption of IID is almost always unrealistic...

- We call these of estimators [robust]{.blue} because they provide [consistent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_estimator) estimates of the SE even when errors are not [independent]{.blue} and [identically distributed]{.blue}.

## Robust standard errors in R

![](images/08_robust.jpg)

## `lm_robust()` {.smaller}

In this weeks lab we will get practice using the `lm_robust()` function from the `estimatr`.

As you will see, `lm_robust()` provides a convenient way to: 

- calculate a variety of robust [standard errors]{.blue} using the `se_type = "stata"` argument for example to get the SEs Stata uses
- include [fixed effects]{.blue} using `fixed_effects = ~ st + year` argument
- cluster standard errors by some grouping id variable `cluster=st`
- generate estimates quickly using the [Cholesky Decomposition]{.blue}


# {{<fa magnifying-glass >}} Previewing Lab 8{.inverse}

## Overview

The goals of this weeks lab are to:

- Help develop your inuition behind the Two-way Fixed Effects Estimator

- Learn how to estimate models with fixed effects and robust clustered standard errors using `lm_robust()`

- Interpret the marginal effects of interaction models

## Recreating Figure 2

## Task

Question 8 from last week's lab asked you to recreate Figure 2 from @Grumbach2022-zj



## {{< fa code >}} Code

```{r}
#| label: fig2data

# Load data
load(url("https://pols1600.paultesta.org/files/data/cps_clean.rda"))

# Calculate turnout by age group and SDR
cps %>% 
  group_by(age_group, SDR) %>% 
  summarise(
    prop_vote = mean(dv_voted, na.rm=T)
  ) -> fig2_df

# Recreate figure 2
fig2_df %>% 
  filter(!is.na(age_group)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(age_group,prop_vote,fill = SDR))+
  geom_bar(stat = "identity",
           position = "dodge") -> fig2

## Q3.1 Describing variation across states {.smaller}

:::panel-tabset

## Task

Q3 will ask you to describe variation in turnout across states and years, and policy.

Let's get a little practice calculating turnout across states


## {{< fa code >}} Code

```{r}
#| label: fig3_1data


# Calculate turnout by state
cps %>% 
  group_by(st) %>% 
  summarise(
    turnout = mean(dv_voted, na.rm=T)
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    st = fct_reorder(st, turnout)
    ) -> df_state



# Visualize turnout by state
df_state %>% 
  ggplot(aes(turnout,st))+
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") -> fig3_1
```


## {{<fa chart-line>}} Fig 3.1

```{r}
#| label: fig3_1
#| echo: false

fig3_1
```


## {{< fa lightbulb >}} Fixed Effects

As you can see, there is considerable variation in average turnout across States

Q3.2 will ask you to describe similar variation across years.

Q3.3 will then ask you to look at variation across SDR policy within a single state.

The goal these questions is to help illustrate motivation for including [fixed effects]{.blue} as way of generalizing the logic of a [difference in differences]{.blue} design
