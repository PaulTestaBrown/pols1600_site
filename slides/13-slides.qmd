# Overview

## General Plan

## What was this course about?

--

-   How would you know?

--

-   How would convince someone who thinks they know different?

--

-   What would it take to change what you think you know?

## Why Quantitative Social Science?

What makes for quantitative social science

-   Compelling?

-   Useful?

-   Hard?

--

Statistical methods and programming are tools not answers

--

Producing knowledge requires us to match theory with empirical design

--

Being "right" is less important than understanding all the ways you might be wrong.

--

Good social science is urgent, eclectic, transparent, contingent, and ?

## What you've learned

Skills and concepts to help understand and practice quantitative social science

-   **Causal Inference** is about counterfactual comparisons

    -   Experimental designs $\to$ random assignment

    -   Observational design $\to$ identifying assumptions $\to$ conditional independence

-   **Regression** is a tool for describing relationships

    -   OLS provides a linear approximation of the Conditional Expectation Function

    -   Regression can be used for descriptive, predictive, and causal inference.

-   **Statistical inference** is about quantifying uncertainty about what could have happened

    -   Confidence intervals provide a range of plausible values for we observed

    -   Hypothesis tests describe the conditional probability of observing what we did, if some hypothesis were true.

.pull-right\[

```{r}
#| echo = F

df%>%
  ggplot(aes(eval_2))+
  geom_density()+
  geom_rug()
```

## How'd you do?

```{r}
#| echo = F,
#| fig.height = 6

df%>%
  ggplot(aes(eval_1,eval_3, col = eval_2))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope =1)+

  ylim(0,100)+
  labs(
    x = "You",
    y = "Your Peers",
    col = "Me"
  )+theme_bw()
```

## Are you happy you took POLS 1600?

```{r}
#| echo = F
df %>%
  mutate(
    Happy = case_when(
      happy == 1 ~ "Yes",
      happy == 2 ~ "No",
      T ~ "Just here for the tacos"
    ),
    Happy = factor(Happy, levels = c("Just here for the tacos","No","Yes"))
  )  %>%
  ggplot(aes(Happy, fill = Happy))+
  geom_bar(stat = "count")+
  scale_fill_brewer()+
  coord_flip()
```

```{r}
#| label = "happy",
#| echo = F
DT::datatable(df %>% 
                select(happy_why),
               fillContainer = F,
              height = "90%",
              options = list(
                pageLength = 2
              )
              )
```

## What I'll Do

-   Lectures:
    -   Less is more
    -   How much math...
    -   More supplemental content (class notes)
    -   More active learning
    -   Integrating the textbook

--

-   Labs:
    -   Seemed to work ok
    -   Group work vs individual learning?
    -   Greater integration with textbook and lecture

--

-   Assignments and Grading
    -   Mostly liked the group project
    -   Tutorials were helpful
    -   More individualized assignments/accountability?

-   Wrote for the school paper

> "What’s one thing (or more) you wish you had done?"

-   Taken more math classes...

> "What’s one thing (or more) you wish you hadn’t done? Can be school or social or planning for post college related"

-   Slept in because I worked late at the paper

> "Are there academic careers in PoliSci that aren't math/statistics based?"

--

-   Yes! Why do you ask?

> "Did you doubt yourself throughout your higher education career? How did you overcome it? Oftentimes, I have very high standards for myself that I am not capable of meeting and which bring a lot of shame. I fear my ability to succeed and actually obtain the career I seek requires skills, abilities, and experience that I never seem any closer to acquiring. Did you think you would end up here at Brown? How DID you end up at Brown?"
