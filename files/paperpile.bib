  abstract  = "Within the context of a social movement, a niche is a set of its
               supporters' characteristics that define the movement's location
               in a multidimensional space. Niches may clearly separate
               movements from one another or niches may overlap. This article
               examines the realization of an activist niche by Black Lives
               Matter (BLM), which has become one of the most prominent
               movements of the early twenty-first century. It draws on surveys
               of 3,860 activists conducted in Washington, DC, in 2017 and
               2018, and 393 surveys of activists participating in the March
               for Racial Justice in five cities in 2017. The results show that
               BLM activists formed a niche along five dimensions. First, BLM
               activists have a greater-than-average commitment to
               intersectional activism than do comparable activists in other
               movements. Second, they use social media more regularly for
               political purposes than do their peers working on other causes,
               which helps the movement operate in a decentralized fashion.
               Third, they are less satisfied with how democracy is practiced
               in the United States. Fourth, they are more likely to
               acknowledge justifications for using violence for political
               purposes. Fifth, they report having experienced high levels of
               anger in conjunction with politics.",

               evidence about the persuasiveness of narrative information on
               individuals' decision making. Seventeen studies met the review
               criteria; 41\% of studies employed first person narration, 59\%
               third person. Narrative information influenced decision making
               more than the provision of no additional information and/or
               statistically based information in approximately a third of the
               studies (5/17); studies employing first person narratives were
               twice as likely to find an effect. There was some evidence that
               narrative information encouraged the use of heuristic rather
               than systematic processing. However, there was little
               consistency in the methods employed and the narratives' content

               process and outcome, whether narratives facilitate or bias

               the decision being made. Until evidence is provided on why and

               non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and the specific
               risks with Cox-2 specific NSAIDs (COXIBs). METHODS: We performed
               meta-analyses examining the risks of developing cardiac failure
               in observational studies and in randomised controlled trials
               (RCTs) involving patients with arthritis and non-rheumatic
               disorders. Electronic databases and published bibliographies
               were systematically searched (1997-2008). RESULTS: Five
               case-control studies (4657 patients, 45,862 controls) showed a
               non-significant association between NSAIDs and cardiac failure
               in a random effect model (odds ratio (OR) 1.36; 95\% CI

               control years) showed a significant risk of cardiac failure with
               NSAIDs (relative risk 1.97; 95\% CI 1.73-2.25). Six
               placebo-controlled trials (naproxen, rofecoxib and celecoxib) in
               non-rheumatic diseases (15,750 patients) showed more cardiac
               failure with NSAIDs (Peto OR 2.31; 95\% CI 1.34, 4.00). Six RCTs
               comparing conventional NSAIDs and COXIBs in arthritis (62,653
               patients) showed no difference in cardiac failure risk (Peto OR
               1.14; 95\% CI 0.85-1.53). CONCLUSION: Observational studies and
               RCTs all show that NSAIDs increase the risk of cardiac failure.
               Overall risks are relatively small and are similar with
               conventional NSAIDs and COXIBs. Pre-existing cardiac failure

               behaviors that pit their interests against their values, perhaps
               self-interest will play a larger role. Post-Affordable Care Act
               (ACA) health insurance coverage provides an important test for

               Certainly there is tax evasion, draft evasion, and even outright
               resistance; yet to a remarkable extent citizens acquiesce and
               even actively consent to the demands of governments, well beyond
               the point explicable by coercion. This is a puzzle for social
               scientists, particularly those who believe that individuals are
               self-interested, rational actors who calculate only the private
               egoistic costs and benefits of possible choices. The provisions
               of collective good should never justify a quasi-voluntary tax
               payment and the benefits of a war could not possibly exceed the
               cost of dying. This book explains the institutionalization of
               policy in response to anticipated and actual citizen behaviour
               and the conditions under which citizens give, refuse and
               withdraw their consent. Professor Levi claims that citizens'
               consent is contingent upon the perceived fairness of both the
               government and of other citizens. Most citizens of democracies,
               most of the time, are more likely to give their consent if they
               believe that government actors and other citizens are behaving

  abstract  = "The argument put forward in this paper is that successful
               implementation of research into practice is a function of the
               interplay of three core elements--the level and nature of the
               evidence, the context or environment into which the research is
               to be placed, and the method or way in which the process is
               facilitated. It also proposes that because current research is
               inconclusive as to which of these elements is most important in
               successful implementation they all should have equal standing.
               This is contrary to the often implicit assumptions currently
               being generated within the clinical effectiveness agenda where
               the level and rigour of the evidence seems to be the most
               important factor for consideration. The paper offers a

              policy preferences, and political engagement. We exploit a
              natural experiment in the Aegean Sea, where Greek islands close

              refugee arrivals, while similar islands slightly farther away did
              not. Leveraging a targeted survey of 2,070 island residents and
              distance to Turkey as an instrument, we find that direct exposure
              to refugee arrivals induces sizable and lasting increases in
              natives' hostility toward refugees, immigrants, and Muslim
              minorities; support for restrictive asylum and immigration

               commonly used policy approach to public health problems. Yet,
               experimental methods that assess the impact of information
               campaigns may misestimate their effects by failing to account
               for respondents' willingness to receive new information.
               Methods: This article uses a doubly randomized survey experiment
               conducted on a nationally representative sample, where some
               subjects are randomly assigned to an informational treatment
               about opioids while other subjects are given the choice of
               whether to receive treatment or not, to examine how public
               willingness to seek new information shapes the way they update
               their preferences about policies related to the opioid epidemic.
               Findings: Among those likely to receive information, treatment
               has a large positive effect on increasing support for policies
               that address the opioid epidemic by about one half of a standard
               deviation. Among those who would avoid this information,
               preferences appear to be unmoved by treatment. These effects
               would be missed by standard experimental designs. Conclusion:
               While redressing information asymmetries is only one part of a
               public health strategy for addressing the opioid epidemic, our

              that aid to refugees exacerbates anti-refugee violence by
              increasing hosts' resentment toward refugees. In contrast,
              however, aid may reduce violence in ways such as increasing host

              transfers to Syrian refugees in Lebanon did not increase
              anti-refugee violence, and if anything they reduced violence.
              Exploring why aid does not increase hostility, we find evidence
              that aid allows recipients to indirectly compensate locals
              through higher demand for local goods and services, directly
              benefit locals by offering help and sharing aid, and reduce

               stringency and timing of state-issued social distancing policies
               to test their effects on population mobility from March to
               December 2020 across 109 states in Brazil, Mexico, and the

               orders and workplace closures jointly reduced mobility,
               especially early in the pandemic. In Mexico, where federal
               government intervention created greater policy uniformity across
               states, workplace closures produced the most consistent
               reduction in mobility. Conventional explanations of compliance

               thousands of times across the American South in the late
               nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, yet we know scarcely
               more about any of these other victims than we do about Henderson
               Lee. Drawing on new sources to provide the most comprehensive
               portrait of the men and women lynched in the American South, Amy
               Bailey and Stewart Tolnay's revealing profiles and careful
               analysis begin to restore the identities of---and lend dignity
               to---hundreds of lynching victims about whom we have known
               little more than their names and alleged offenses. Comparing
               victims' characteristics to those of African American men who
               were not lynched, Bailey and Tolnay identify the factors that

               Assessing these factors in the context of current scholarship on

               commonly emphasized in previous research, but largely by
               political factors. Introducing a novel framework for explaining
               pandemic policymaking, the study shows the central importance of
               political parties, presidential power, and governors' coalitions
               in determining state-level policy stringency. In the United
               States and Mexico, statistical and qualitative evidence

               resulted instead from intrastate factors and diffusion.

              survey experiment with subjects voting in hypothetical
              congressional primary elections, we find that respondents from

              candidate has previously served in elected office. However, these

              study. It is also increasingly widely recognized that the high
              rates of pretrial detention, often linked to the use of money
              bail, are unjust, expensive, and often counterproductive. But, so
              far, the links between money bail, pretrial detention, and mass
              incarceration have been largely unexplored. Our criminal justice
              system relies primarily on plea bargains to secure convictions at
              a relatively low cost. And, as shown by recent empirical work,
              the bail system, which results in high pretrial detention rates
              for indigent defendants, plays a significant role in
              incentivizing quick pleas, and leads to more convictions and
              longer sentences. Releasing more defendants pretrial would
              generate more pretrial motions, lengthier plea negotiations, and
              more trials, and would thus raise the cost--in the form of
              prosecutors, public defenders, and judges--of convictions and
              imprisonment. In other words, if we release significantly more
              defendants pretrial, we will have to either spend more on
              criminal justice or convict fewer people and punish them less
              severely. In addition to inducing quick, inexpensive guilty pleas
              from defendants unable to post bond, money bail also plays a more
              subtle role in sustaining high incarceration rates. Money bail,
              by its very nature, discriminates based on wealth, and thus
              provides a built-in sorting mechanism--politically weak lowincome
              defendants are pushed into the quick-plea process, while
              wealthier defendants are able to obtain release and the increased
              access to more robust process that it affords. If politically
              better-represented wealthy and middle-class defendants were
              detained, and thus subjected to at least some of the same
              pressures to plead guilty as indigent defendants, there would, in
              all likelihood, be more demand for reform. This Article explores
              the role of bail in mass incarceration, concluding that opponents
              of mass incarceration should pay increased attention to the
              pretrial process as a locus of reform. Relatedly, it analyzes the
              likely impact of the bail-plea bargain link on future bail
              reform--which, of course, serves important interests beyond
              reducing the prison population, such as fairness and the
              avoidance of wrongful convictions. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

  abstract = "Triple difference has become a widely used estimator in empirical
              work. A close reading of articles in top economics journals
              reveals that the use of the estimator to a large extent rests on
              intuition. The identifying assumptions are neither formally
              derived nor generally agreed on. We give a complete presentation
              of the triple difference estimator, and show that even though the
              estimator can be computed as the difference between two
              difference-indifferences estimators, it does not require two
              parallel trend assumptions to have a causal interpretation. The
              reason is that the difference between two biased
              difference-indifferences estimators will be unbiased as long as
              the bias is the same in both estimators. This requires only one

  abstract  = "How does violence become publicly unacceptable? I address this
               question in the context of lynching in the United States.
               Between 1880 and the 1930s, public discourse about lynching
               moved from open or tacit endorsement to widespread condemnation.
               I argue this occurred because of increasing publicity for
               lynchings. While locals justified nearby lynchings, publicity
               exposed lynching to distant, un-supportive audiences and allowed
               African Americans to safely articulate counternarratives and
               condemnations. I test this argument using data on lynchings,
               rail networks, and newspaper coverage of lynchings in millions
               of issues across thousands of newspapers. I find that lynchings
               in counties with greater access to publicity (via rail networks)
               saw more and geographically dispersed coverage, that distant
               coverage was more critical, and that increased risk of media
               exposure may have reduced the incidence of lynching. I discuss
               how publicity could be a mechanism for strengthening or
               weakening justifications of violence in other contexts.",

               expressing doubt about one's view or presenting arguments
               against it would seem to weaken one's case, but can sometimes
               promote it. We propose a framework for understanding these

               identify conditions under which and mechanisms through which
               these actions boost persuasion. Acts of receptiveness appear to
               be more persuasive when they come from expert or high-status
               sources, rather than non-expert or low-status sources, and to

               distinguish between ``external validity'' and theoretical

               experimental research. Our point of departure is the 2012 study
               by Berinsky, Huber, and Lenz that compares Amazon's Mechanical
               Turk to US national probability samples in terms of respondent

               of understanding public affairs and how they use this

              Participants assigned to a mixed-race group had more positive

              minority interest advocacy for nearly a century, as marginalized

              manner, there is no guarantee that onlookers will perceive them
              as such. We find it necessary to explore what factors shape
              perceptions of social movement protests and how the racial
              composition of a demonstration can elicit dramatically different
              responses from onlookers. Methods: To examine the impact of
              racial identity on protest evaluations, we conduct a survey
              experiment on a total of 921 respondents. We simulate a media
              report concerning a Black Lives Matter protest to determine how
              subtle changes in the racial composition of the demonstration
              elicit varying perceptions of a potential for violence. Results:
              We find that protests that comprise all-Black participants are
              perceived to have a higher probability to end in violence than
              more diverse demonstrations. These findings come despite an
              assurance that the protest in question was peaceful. Consistent
              with minority threat theory, these perceptions are largely driven
              by the sentiments of white respondents. Conclusion: We argue that
              ill-conceived threat perceptions, rooted in the racial
              composition of Black Lives Matter protests, complicate the
              mission of those charged with making visible the plight of Black
              Americans. Even when Black protesters adhere to the ``rules'' of
              non-violent protest, there is no guarantee that the biases of
              onlookers will not drown out their efforts. These findings have
              wide reaching implications on the exercise of First Amendment
              right to protest, the role of the media in reporting on protests,
              and the expectations of government interactions with protesters.",

               that how protest tactics are perceived is not a purely objective
               determination, but can be influenced in part by observer
               characteristics--in particular, by partisan identity. We
               conducted a survey experiment on two independent samples through
               the MTurk platform, randomly assigning protester group identity
               and tactics. Results show that when controlling for assigned
               tactics, self-identified Republicans but not Democrats perceive
               higher levels of violence when a disliked group is protesting.
               The effect is strongest in regard to tactics that are nominally
               the least disruptive. The findings have implications for
               theories of nonviolent protest, the legitimacy of repression,

              address this shortcoming by exploring how the race of an author
              influences support for, and perceptions of, the Black Lives
              Matter (BLM) movement. Drawing from literature on opinion
              formation and social identity theory, we expect that whites will
              be most persuaded by whites, while Asian Americans will not be
              particularly persuaded by co-ethnic messengers due to relatively
              low levels of group identity. To test our hypotheses, we use two
              online surveys that oversample Asian American respondents who are
              randomly assigned letters in support of BLM written by either an
              Asian American author or a white author. Similar to previous
              research, we find that whites are more likely to respond to
              appeals from co-racial individuals. However, we find that Asian
              Americans respond positively to co-ethnic and white messengers.
              Further analysis reveals that Asian Americans' lower levels of
              in-group preferences compared with whites explains why they do
              not respond to co-racial individuals similarly to other groups.",

              controversies related to policing and ``law and order'' during
              the 2016 presidential campaign. Following incidences of social
              unrest sparked by lethal confrontations between police officers
              and people of color, Donald Trump condemned protesters and
              expressed unwavering support for the police, while Hillary
              Clinton and Bernie Sanders expressed empathy with communities of
              color and called for criminal justice reform. Method: We
              conducted a framing experiment to test whether exposure to images
              designed to evoke a range of hostile to benign police--civilian
              interactions affected respondents' vote preference in the lead-up
              to the presidential election. Results: We found that exposure to
              an image of police--civilian interactions decreased the
              likelihood that a respondent would choose not to express a vote
              preference. This effect was most pronounced among political
              independents and respondents low in political awareness. We also
              found that exposure to a picture of the militarized police
              response to protesters in Ferguson, Missouri, significantly
              altered candidate choice, and this effect varied across political
              partisanship. Conclusions: We conclude that electoral rhetoric
              about crime, mass protests, and ``law and order'' continues to be
              impactful in 21st-century American politics. We also find some
              evidence consistent with the ``shy Trump voters'' hypothesis that
              some people were unwilling to publicly disclose their preference
              for Donald Trump in pre-election polls.",

  abstract  = "Previous studies have established that people encode the race of
               each individual they encounter, and do so via computational
               processes that appear to be both automatic and mandatory. If
               true, this conclusion would be important, because categorizing
               others by their race is a precondition for treating them
               differently according to race. Here we report experiments, using
               unobtrusive measures, showing that categorizing individuals by
               race is not inevitable, and supporting an alternative
               hypothesis: that encoding by race is instead a reversible
               byproduct of cognitive machinery that evolved to detect
               coalitional alliances. The results show that subjects encode
               coalitional affiliations as a normal part of person
               representation. More importantly, when cues of coalitional
               affiliation no longer track or correspond to race, subjects
               markedly reduce the extent to which they categorize others by
               race, and indeed may cease doing so entirely. Despite a
               lifetime's experience of race as a predictor of social alliance,
               less than 4 min of exposure to an alternate social world was
               enough to deflate the tendency to categorize by race. These
               results suggest that racism may be a volatile and eradicable

              sex-specific illnesses and disorders. Historically, it was argued
              that such differences were largely, if not exclusively, due to
              gonadal hormone secretions. However, emerging research has shown
              that some differences are mediated by mechanisms other than the
              action of these hormone secretions and in particular by products
              of genes located on the X and Y chromosomes, which we refer to as
              direct genetic effects. This paper reviews the evidence for
              direct genetic effects in behavioral and brain sex differences.
              We highlight the 'four core genotypes' model and sex differences
              in the midbrain dopaminergic system, specifically focusing on the
              role of Sry. We also discuss novel research being done on unique
              populations including people attracted to the same sex and people
              with a cross-gender identity. As science continues to advance our
              understanding of biological sex differences, a new field is
              emerging that is aimed at better addressing the needs of both
              sexes: gender-based biology and medicine. Ultimately, the study
              of the biological basis for sex differences will improve

  abstract = "Causal mediation analysis requires measurement of an outcome
              variable (O) with and without treatment, plus a set of mediator
              variables (M) that constitute possible pathways for the treatment
              effect. There is no consensus on whether surveys should measure
              potentially mediating variables before or after the outcome
              variables-MO or OM. We use a replication exercise to demonstrate
              how the order of mediator and outcome items can be consequential
              for the results from causal mediation analysis. Order can affect
              mediation conclusions, even if the treatment effect is similar
              across designs. As such, randomizing order is usually prudent,
              although best practice depends on the researcher's contextual
              knowledge about her particular application. C ausal mediation
              analysis (CMA) aims to decompose treatment effects by mediating
              channel. It is rapidly growing in popularity, especially in
              survey-experimental work. When designing an instrument, an
              important choice arises: whether to measure outcomes then
              mediators (an OM design) or mediators then outcomes (MO). It is
              unclear which to prefer, and there is no consensus in the
              existing literature. MO resembles the posited causal sequence,
              but researchers often measure the outcome directly after
              treatment , to prevent intervening questions from moderating
              treatment effects. In this short article, we argue that the OM/MO
              choice can affect (1) the distribution of outcome variables or
              mediators, (2) the effect of treatment on either, and (3)
              mediation results , even when it does not moderate the overall
              treatment effect. The first two occur because ordering can alter
              how respondents understand later questions, by priming latent
              thoughts or framing issues, or because survey fatigue induces
              satisficing or anchoring in later questions. The third effect is
              more subtle: even if the treatment effect is similar under both
              designs, the proportions of the effect attributed to a particular
              mediator can still change. Importantly, this effect can occur
              even when the first two do not. After describing these three
              effects theoretically, we demonstrate them in practice by
              replicating a prominent survey experiment on democratic-peace
              theory (Tomz and Weeks 2013). While OM and MO versions produced
              similar estimates of the overall treatment effect, the survey
              design affected distributions of some variables (effect 1),
              although it did not affect relationships between variables
              (effect 2). Still, design choice affected mediation results,
              altering which mediators mattered more for the overall effect
              (effect 3). We conclude with guidance on how researchers should
              proceed, offering some guidelines. In addition to using

              policies on human mobility and COVID‐19 case growth rates, with a
              spatiotemporal emphasis. Our results demonstrate that
              stay‐at‐home orders, workplace closures, and public information
              campaigns were effective in decreasing the confirmed case growth
              rate. For stay‐at‐home orders and workplace clo-sures, these
              changes were associated with significant decreases (p < 0.05) in
              mobility. Public information campaigns did not see these same
              mobility trends, but the growth rate still decreased
              sig-nificantly in all analysis periods (p < 0.01). Stay‐at‐home
              orders and international/national travel controls had limited

  abstract  = "In this chapter we discuss the role of attitudes in human social
               behavior. We will show that, in order to understand the
               influence of attitudes on behavior, we must distinguish between
               two types of attitude. The first type are general attitudes
               toward physical objects (Yosemite National Park, the Empire
               State Building); racial, ethnic, or other groups (African
               Americans, Jews, gays); institutions (Congress, the Catholic
               Church); policies (gun control, tax cuts); events (September 11,
               the World Series); or other general targets. The second type are
               attitudes toward performing specific behaviors with respect to
               an object or target (visiting Yosemite National Park, hiring an
               African American, etc.). These attitudes will be referred to as
               attitudes toward a behavior. A parallel distinction will be made
               between broad behavioral categories or multiple-act aggregates
               and single behaviors. We first consider the problems and issues
               involved in relating general and behavior-specific attitudes to
               multiple-act aggregates and to single behaviors. Our discussion
               of the determinants of specific behaviors is guided largely by a
               reasoned action approach that assumes that people's behavior
               follows reasonably from their beliefs, attitudes, and
               intentions. We focus on this causal analysis because a great
               deal of contemporary research concerning the influence of
               attitudes on behavior is conducted within this conceptual
               framework. We recognize the possibility that influence can also
               flow from attitudes and behaviors to beliefs, but these topics
               are covered in other chapters of this volume. Similarly, the
               effect of attitude change on changes in behavior is not a major
               focus because it is discussed elsewhere in this volume.

              public, with a focus on social policies in the United States and
              Europe. It shows that existing policies feed back into the
              political system, shaping subsequent policy outcomes. Policies
              exert this effect by altering not only the capacities, interests,
              and beliefs of political elites and states but also those of the
              public. Public policies can shape political participation and
              attitudes. These effects can be positive or negative, enhancing
              or undercutting participation and conferring positive or negative
              messages about individuals' worth as citizens. These effects
              originate in elements of program design, such as the size,
              visibility, and traceability of benefits, the proximity of
              beneficiaries, and modes of program administration. Thus, public

  abstract  = "Emotion and rationality are fundamental elements of human life.
               They are abstract concepts, often difficult to define and grasp.
               Thus throughout the history of Western society, the head and the
               heart, concrete and identifiable elements, have been used as
               symbols of rationality and emotion. Drawing on the conceptual
               metaphor framework, we propose that people understand the
               abstract concepts of rationality and emotion using knowledge of
               a more concrete concept-the vertical difference between the head
               and heart. In six studies, we show a deep-seated conceptual
               metaphorical relationship linking rationality with ``up'' or
               ``higher'' and emotion with ``down'' or ``lower.'' We show that
               the association between verticality and rationality/emotion
               affects how consumers perceive information and thereby has
               downstream consequences on attitudes and preferences. We find
               the association to be most influential when consumers are
               unaware of it and when it applies to an unfamiliar stimulus.
               Because all visual formats-from the printed page to screens on a
               television, computer, or smartphone-entail a vertical placement,
               this association has important managerial implications. Our

               influential account of the role of political elites in shaping
               public opinion. Zaller's subsequent work has focused less on the
               mechanics of opinion change than on the role of public opinion
               in the broader political process. This evolution has entailed
               sustained attention to V. O. Key, Jr.'s concept of ``latent
               opinion''-the opinion politicians are likely to face in the next
               election, as distinct from what is currently measureable in
               surveys. It has also entailed a downgrading of the importance

               Rather, it causes racially liberal whites to evaluate Trump more

               old-fashioned racism, and partisanship are taken into account.

               an epistemic view of politics in which the ultimate determinants
               of political action are ideas about the society in which we act.
               These ideas are usually mediated to us by others, so Zaller
               begins the book by describing its topic as the influence of the
               media on public opinion, and he includes journalists among the
               ``political elites'' who exert this influence (along with
               politicians, public officials, and experts). But the book
               eventually reduces journalists to being messengers of
               politicians' cues to the public. This understanding of the media
               is built into the book's model of opinion formation, in which
               cued predispositions are pivotal to the acceptance or rejection
               of culturally mediated ``messages''-but are themselves insulated
               from cultural influence. A cueing model of message reception,
               however, ignores messages that are differentially persuasive not
               because of the predispositions they cue but the content they
               convey. Gauging the heterogeneous persuasiveness of messages
               requires qualitative content analysis and cultural
               contextualization, and if this research is to contribute to a
               general understanding of public opinion, it will have to extend
               beyond news-media messages to ideational influences carried in
               high culture, formal education, and the entertainment media. All
               of these sources of ideas, in turn, may contribute to the
               shaping of predispositions, as suggested in part by public
               opinion regarding the Vietnam War. Research of this kind would
               signal a new type of political science that focused on the
               actual thoughts of real people trying to understand a complex
               environment: exactly the type of political science suggested at
               the beginning of Zaller's book. \copyright{} 2012 Copyright

               science. Combining philosophical charity with logical clarity,
               he defended the validity of religious experience against crass
               forms of scientism. Dewey identified the myriad ways in which
               supernatural concerns distract religious adherents from pressing
               social concerns, and sought to reconcile the tensions inherent
               in science's dual embrace of common sense and the aesthetic.
               James and Dewey on Belief and Experience is divided into two

               That is, once people have received information from political
               elites, they tend to abide by whatever their respective
               cue-givers dictate, since rejecting information is more
               cognitively costly than simply accepting it. Empirical research
               in psychology on priming supports this view of the citizen as a
               passive receiver of information. For example, people are likely
               to be unconsciously influenced by subtle cues and they tend to
               base their opinions on the accessibility of information in
               memory. However, some citizens, under certain conditions, may be
               ``active processors'' of information: actively interpreting it,
               elaborating on its implications, and negotiating its meaning.
               Whether or not Zaller's model is an accurate representation of
               the process of public-opinion formation depends substantially
               upon the inclusiveness of the researcher's views about what

               responses. In Study 1, we hypothesized that direct experience
               with an attitude object would tend to produce more affective
               reactions than indirect experience with the object and,
               alternatively, that indirect experience would produce more
               cognitive reactions than indirect experience with the object. To
               test this, participants were given either a direct or an
               indirect experience with a set of puzzles and then required to
               indicate their reactions to the puzzles. As predicted, direct
               experience produced more affective reactions and indirect
               experience produced more cognitive reactions. In Study 2, we
               hypothesized that attitudes produced after direct experience
               would predict consummatory behavior better than instrumental
               behavior and that attitudes produced after indirect experience
               would do the opposite. Again the results supported the
               hypothesis. In Study 3, we hypothesized that attitude
               accessibility mediates the relationships found in Study 2. That
               is, in a consummatory situation attitudes formed through direct
               experience are more assessable that attitudes formed through
               indirect experience. The results supported the hypothesis.

               productive ways in which citizens respond to oppressive
               encounters with police. The political discourses used by Portals
               participants, we argue, are centered on a logic of ``collective
               autonomy''-given police ignorance, abuses of police authority,
               and the little political power that residents of highly policed
               communities have to demand change, many conclude that power is
               best achieved by strategically distancing from state
               institutions in the short term while building community power in
               the long term. Crucially, articulations of collective autonomy

  abstract = "People often use their own feelings as a basis to predict others'
              feelings. For example, when trying to gauge how much someone else
              enjoys a television show, people might think ``How much do I
              enjoy it?'' and use this answer as basis for estimating others'
              reactions. Although personal experience (such as actually
              watching the show oneself) often improves empathic accuracy, we
              found that gaining too much experience can impair it. Five
              experiments highlight a desensitization bias in emotional
              perspective taking, with consequences for social prediction,
              social judgment, and social behavior. Participants who viewed
              thrilling or shocking images many times predicted first-time
              viewers would react less intensely (Experiments 1 and 2);
              participants who heard the same funny joke or annoying noise many
              times estimated less intense reactions of first-time listeners
              (Experiments 3 and 4); and further, participants were less likely
              to actually share good jokes and felt less bad about blasting
              others with annoying noise after they themselves became
              desensitized to those events (Experiments 3-5). These effects
              were mediated by participants' own attenuated reactions.
              Moreover, observers failed to anticipate this bias, believing
              that overexposed participants (i.e., repeatedly exposed
              participants who became desensitized) would make better decisions
              on their behalf (Experiment 5). Taken together, these findings
              reveal a novel paradox in emotional perspective taking: If people
              experience an evocative event many times, they may not become
              wiser companions but worse, unable to disentangle self-change
              from other-oriented thinking. Just as lacking exposure to others'
              experiences can create gaps in empathy and understanding, so may

  abstract  = "This article examines the role of racial/ethnic diversity in
               county-level support for California's illegal immigration
               initiative (Proposition 187). We conceptualize California
               counties in terms of their homogeneous , heterogeneous, or
               bifurcated racial/ethnic composition. We argue racial/ethnic
               context is critical beyond individual-level factors; this
               context is central in explaining public policy, especially
               policies that affect minority groups. The vote for Proposition
               187 is expected to be the highest in ``bifur-cated'' counties
               with large Latino populations. Regression analysis is used to
               statistically model the county-level vote for the initiative
               relative to the size of racial/ethnic populations, economic
               conditions , and party. Bifurcated counties with large Latino
               populations strongly supported Proposition 187, as well as
               homogeneous counties with predominately white and very small
               minority populations. California's white/Latino bifurcated
               racial/ethnic composition may parallel the white/black
               bifurca-tion of the deep South in an earlier era. The importance
               of the theory and empirical findings presented extend beyond
               California to national and subnational politics. WXThile
               ethnicity/race is often seen as important in U.S. politics, it
               has not always been systematically incorporated into political
               science research (Hero and Tolbert 1996; Radcliff and Saiz
               1994). This study examines voting patterns on California's 1994
               ``illegal immigration'' initiative, Proposition 187. Consistent
               with a ``racial/ ethnic diversity'' interpretation of politics
               and policy in the states, it finds that racial/ethnic diversity
               plays an important role in explaining county-level support for
               Proposition 187 (Hero and Tolbert 1996; cf. Wolfinger and
               Greenstein 1968). California voters supported Proposition 187 by
               a 59\%-41\% overall margin. The ballot initiative denies social
               services, nonemergency health care, and education to illegal
               immigrants and requires public agencies to report suspected
               illegal immigrants to state and federal authorities. Although
               federal courts placed an injunction on implementation of parts
               of the measure days after the election, this policy has
               important implications for both national and subnational
               politics. Proposition 187 is not unique in the history of

  abstract  = "Over the past two decades, political scientists have
               demonstrated that racial animus among white Americans is
               increasingly associated with evaluations of presidential
               candidates. Like most work on white racial attitudes, these
               efforts have focused almost exclusively on the out-group
               attitudes whites possess toward racial and ethnic minorities.
               Work in social psychology, however, suggests that intergroup
               attitudes are usually comprised of both an out-group and an
               in-group component. Nevertheless, political scientists have
               tended to overlook or dismiss the possibility that whites'
               in-group attitudes are associated with political evaluations.
               Changing demographic patterns, immigration, the historic
               election of Obama, and new candidate efforts to appeal to whites
               as a collective group suggest a need to reconsider the full
               nature and consequences of the racial attitudes that may
               influence whites' electoral preferences. This study, therefore,
               examines the extent to which both white out-group racial
               resentment and white in-group racial identity matter in
               contemporary electoral politics. Comparing the factors
               associated with vote choice in 2012 and 2016, and candidate
               evaluations in 2018, this study finds that both attitudes were
               powerfully associated with candidate evaluations in 2012 and
               early 2016, although white out-group attitudes overshadowed the
               electoral impact of in-group racial attitudes by the 2016
               general election. The results suggest that there are now two
               independent racial attitudes tied to whites' political
               preferences in the contemporary U.S., and understanding the
               dynamics of white racial animus and white racial identity across

               which race remains a barrier for African American candidates in
               American elections. Despite a substantial body of work that
               indicates that African Americans do face significant barriers to
               winning White votes, initial interpretations of the 2008
               election results suggest that the Obama vote was not depressed
               because of his race. In this paper, I introduce a relatively
               unobtrusive measure of racial salience to examine whether these
               initial interpretations are correct. I find that when race was a
               more salient factor for White voters, they were substantially
               less likely to vote for Obama and were more likely to think that
               Obama was focusing attention on African Americans during the
               campaign. I estimate that the salience of race for some Whites
               may have cost Obama as much as 3\% of the White vote. Thus, this

               illuminate why citizens would engage in political discussion
               across lines of difference. Advancing hypotheses informed by
               affective intelligence theory, we use two data sets from the

               under which disagreeable discussion is consistent with different
               models of political discussion. Our findings are twofold. First,
               overall we find mixed evidence to support information seeking
               motives. Disagreeable discussion-regardless of conceptualization
               and operationalization-is poorly predicted by emotions
               associated with information seeking (e.g., fear), while it is
               better structured by emotions associated with expression and
               participation (e.g., enthusiasm). Second, leveraging available
               temporal information, we find evidence that, although only

               three types of vignette - snapshots, portraits, and composites -
               as a means of collecting, analyzing, and representing data. They
               provide an example of each and briefly present their evaluative

               norms. However, we know little about the mechanisms underlying
               political conformity. Whose norms are people likely to follow,
               and why? This article discusses two phenomena---social identity
               and ``self-conscious'' emotions---that are key to understanding
               when and why people follow the crowd. It argues that adherence
               to in-group norms is a critical basis of status among in-group
               peers. Conformity generates peer approval and leads to personal
               pride. Deviance generates disapproval and causes embarrassment
               or shame. These emotional reactions color an individual's
               political perspectives, typically generating conformity. These
               same mechanisms can spur between-group polarization. In this
               case, differentiation from the norms of disliked out-groups
               results in peer approval and pride, and conformity to out-group
               norms disapproval and embarrassment or shame. This framework is
               supported by the results of two experiments that examine the
               influence of group opinion norms over economic and social
               aspects of citizens' political ideologies. One exogenously

              unobserved time-invariant confounders comes at the expense of
              dynamic causal relationships, which are permitted under an
              alternative selection-on-observables approach. Using the
              nonparametric directed acyclic graph, we highlight two key causal
              identification assumptions of unit fixed effects models: Past
              treatments do not directly influence current outcome, and past
              outcomes do not affect current treatment. Furthermore, we
              introduce a new nonparametric matching framework that elucidates
              how various unit fixed effects models implicitly compare treated

              establishing the equivalence between matching and weighted unit

              issues raised are general, we focus on applications to
              comparative political economy, which frequently uses TSCS data.
              We begin with a discussion of specification and lay out the
              theoretical differences implied by the various types of dynamic
              models that can be estimated. It is shown that there is nothing
              pernicious in using a lagged dependent variable and that all
              dynamic models either implicitly or explicitly have such a
              variable; the differences between the models relate to
              assumptions about the speeds of adjustment of measured and
              unmeasured variables. When adjustment is quick, it is hard to
              differentiate between the various models; with slower speeds of
              adjustment, the various models make sufficiently different
              predictions that they can be tested against each other. As the
              speed of adjustment gets slower and slower, specification (and
              estimation) gets more and more tricky. We then turn to a
              discussion of estimation. It is noted that models with both a
              lagged dependent variable and serially correlated errors can
              easily be estimated; it is only ordinary least squares that is
              inconsistent in this situation. There is a brief discussion of
              lagged dependent variables combined with fixed effects and issues
              related to non-stationarity. We then show how our favored method
              of modeling dynamics combines nicely with methods for dealing
              with other TSCS issues, such as parameter heterogeneity and
              spatial dependence. We conclude with two examples.",

              The geography of media markets places some voters in a

              U.S. senators, and this increased coverage translates into
              greater knowledge of these officeholders. Further, access to

              candidate evaluation depends largely on skin color and
              afrocentric features. However, like other racial cues, color and

              vary in magnitude and direction across the gender and partisan

              bias, and minority candidates are missing an important aspect of
              racial bias. \copyright{} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media,

              the cost of the relatively privileged, not other minorities. We

               vote against Black political candidates. However, can an
               in-group psychological process have the same effect? We consider
               White racial identity to be a strong candidate for such a
               process. We argue that the mere presence of a Black candidate
               cues the identity, reducing support for these candidates among
               Whites. We test this hypothesis on vote choice in seven
               instances. Five of them involve simple vote choice models: the
               2008 and 2012 Presidential elections, and three elections in
               2010: The Massachusetts Gubernatorial election, Black candidates
               for the US House, and Black candidates for the US Senate. The
               other two are tests of the notion that White racial identity
               reduced President Obama's approval, thus reducing support for
               all Democratic Congressional candidates in the 2010 Midterm and
               2012 Congressional elections. We find support for these notions
               in all seven cases, across these seven elections, using four
               different survey research datasets, and four different measures
               of White identity. Comparisons with other presidential elections
               show that White identity did not significantly affect
               mono-racial elections. Furthermore, we find the White identity
               and racial resentment results to be very similar in terms of
               their robustness and apparent effect sizes. This indicates
               in-group evaluations, and those that focus on out-groups,

               attitudes toward African Americans and evaluations of the

               2012. As predicted by theories of individuation, attitudes
               toward Blacks became increasingly disconnected from evaluations
               of Mr. Obama and from people's electoral choices over time.
               However, levels of prejudice against Blacks rose between 2008
               and 2012. Because of this increased prejudice and the
               diminishing individual-level influence of attitudes toward
               Blacks on electoral choices, prejudice toward Blacks seems to
               have reduced Mr. Obama's vote share in the 2012 election by

               immigration preferences in data from the Multi-Ethnic Module of
               the 2000 General Social Survey. Because the dependent variables

               implicit forms of prejudice (which come to mind automatically

               been accompanied by substantial increases in rates of
               interracial marriage, especially between Black men and non-Black
               women. Explanations for the retreat from marriage among Black
               women have focused on deficits in the quantity and quality of
               available partners, and the role of racial intermarriage largely
               has been ignored. This study examines the impact of interracial
               marriage by Black men on the marriage prospects of Black women.
               First, our analysis of data from the 1990 Integrated Public Use
               Microdata Series (IPUMS) reveals that intermarried Black men are
               selective of those with the highest levels of education, income,
               and occupational prestige. Second, multilevel analyses, using
               both the IPUMS and Panel Study of Income Dynamics, show that the
               level of intermarriage in metropolitan areas is significantly
               related to the marital behaviors of Black women. Local rates of
               intermarriage among Black men reduce the likelihood that Black
               women currently will be married and that they will make the
               transition to marriage. These effects are especially acute for
               highly educated Black women whose marriage markets are defined
               by those Black men who are most likely to intermarry. Finally,
               our analyses indicate that intermarriage affects the marital
               prospects of Black women by negatively affecting the pool of
               economically attractive marriage partners in the metropolitan

               qualitative research, complementary tools would be of great help
               in data collection. Vignette technique is a data collection
               tool, which has been used for over 50 years in different
               disciplines including health sciences. Nonetheless, there is a
               paucity of information regarding this method. With this
               background in mind, the present review aimed to provide thorough
               information about the vignette technique. Methods: This was a
               narrative review conducted through searching of databases of ISI
               Web of Science (65), PubMed (27), Scopus (24), CINAHL (110),
               ProQuest (23), ERIC (44) as well as Science Direct (123) using
               keywords including ``vignette'', ``qualitative research'',
               ``quantitative research'', and ``research'' from their inception
               to September, 2018 to assess those studies regarding different
               aspects of vignettes. Out of 416 documents, a number of 105
               books and articles were reviewed regarding the different aspects
               of the vignettes. No language restrictions were imposed.
               Results: Vignettes are used in different forms including text,
               illustrations, images, videotape and cartoons, computer-based
               data, and music as an elicitation tool to provide supplementary
               and complementary data during a research process. Using this
               technique, the researcher can collect some data which is not
               accessible through other sources. At the same time, the
               researchers should be cautious about its accurate design and
               validity to get more realistic data. Conclusion: Vignettes as an
               effective tool can be employed in both quantitative and
               qualitative research to collect more diverse and thorough data,
               particularly, in cross-cultural research.",

               to be an important determinant of diversity attitudes. Tolerance
               for diversity is also contextually conditioned by the percentage

               for effective representation. Yet the conflict, negativity, and
               competition that are endemic to politics may prevent empathetic
               individuals from seeking office. Using an original national

               explore how citizens' dispositional empathy influences political

              approaches to cybersecurity emphasize either international
              state-to-state logics (such as deter-rence theory) or the
              integrity of individual information systems. Neither provides a
              good understanding of new ``soft cyber'' attacks that involve the
              manipulation of expectations and common understand-ings. We argue
              that scaling up computer security arguments to the level of the
              state, so that the entire polity is treated as an information
              system with associated attack surfaces and threat models,
              provides the best immediate way to understand these attacks and
              how to mitigate them. We demonstrate systematic differences
              between how autocracies and democracies work as information
              systems, because they rely on different mixes of common and
              contested political knowledge. Stable autocracies will have
              common knowledge over who is in charge and their associated
              ideological or policy goals, but will generate contested
              knowledge over who the various political actors in society are,
              and how they might form coalitions and gain public support, so as
              to make it more difficult for coalitions to displace the regime.
              Stable democracies will have contested knowledge over who is in
              charge, but common knowledge over who the political actors are,
              and how they may form coalitions and gain public support. These
              differences are associated with notably different attack surfaces
              and threat models. Specifically, democracies are vulnerable to
              measures that ``flood'' public debate and disrupt shared
              decentralized understandings of actors and coalitions, in ways

              context, acculturation fear and anti-Latino sentiment are strong
              predictors of restrictionist sentiment; in the pre-9/11 period,
              these factors have little substantive impact on Anglo attitudes.
              We theorize that the current climate has helped ``activate''
              social identities, which in turn has deleterious consequences for
              the Latinos in the United States. Using data from the 2000 and
              2004 National Election Studies, we estimate a model of Anglo
              immigration attitudes. We show indicators of acculturation fear,
              anti-Latino sentiment, and media exposure significantly relate to
              Anglo immigration attitudes in the post-9/11 period but not the
              pre-9/11 period. \copyright{} 2011 Southern Political Science

              perceive that party as serving their group's interests, and

              to Asian Americans, an understudied minority population which is
              becoming increasingly politically relevant. Through both a
              large-scale, representative survey and a novel laboratory

              However, our systematic examination of questionnaires, manuals,

              disciplines to investigate possible causal mechanisms. Such an
              analysis allows researchers to explore various causal pathways,
              going beyond the estimation of simple causal effects. Recently,
              Imai et al. (2008) [3] and Imai et al. (2009) [2] devel- oped
              general algorithms to estimate causal mediation effects with the
              variety of data types that are often encountered in practice. The
              new algorithms can estimate causal mediation effects for linear
              and nonlinear relationships, with parametric and nonparametric
              models, with continuous and discrete medi- ators, and with
              various types of outcome variables. In this paper, we show how to
              implement these algorithms in the statistical computing language
              R. Our easy-to-use software, mediation, takes advantage of the
              object-oriented programming nature of the R language and allows
              researchers to estimate causal mediation effects in a
              straightforward manner. Finally, mediation also implements
              sensitivity analyses which can be used to formally assess the

              collection and the tools to produce the statistical information

              academic, and government sectors. The second era (1960-1990)
              witnessed a vast growth in the use of the survey method. This
              growth was aided by the needs of the U.S. federal government to
              monitor the effects of investments in human and physical
              infrastructure, the growth of the quantitative social sciences,
              and the use of quantitative information to study consumer
              behaviors. The third era (1990 and forward) witnessed the
              declines in survey participation rates, the growth of alternative
              modes of data collection, the weakening of sampling frames, and

              race and gender influenced political attitudes toward Michelle
              Obama and her ability to serve as a meaningful political symbol.
              Using public opinion polls from 2008 to 2017 and data from the

              Americans, with minimal differences between men and women.
              Although white women were no more likely than white men to view
              Michelle Obama favorably, we find that they were more likely to

               among women based on race, class, and other key
               socio-demographic characteristics. In the 2016 Presidential
               contest, political divisions among women were evident in exit
               polling, which demonstrated that a majority of white women voted
               for Donald Trump. This was not an anomaly but reflects a more
               long-standing distinction between white women and women of other
               racial and ethnic identifications. In this paper, we draw on
               intersectionality and system justification theory as frameworks
               for exploring the distinctive political behavior of white women.
               Using data from the 2012 and 2016 American National Election
               Studies, we evaluate the factors that attracted white women
               voters to the GOP and kept them in the fold in spite of
               expectations that sexism in the campaign would drive women away
               from the party during the 2016 Presidential race. Our analyses
               show that many white women endorse sexist beliefs, and that
               these beliefs were strong determinants of their vote choice in
               2016, more so than in 2012. Our findings also point to important
               divisions among white women based on educational attainment and
               household income in terms of both the endorsement of sexism and
               vote choice. These results shed new light on white women's

               analyze the data presented in the U.S. Police-Shooting Database
               (USPSD) in order to investigate the extent of racial bias in the
               shooting of American civilians by police officers in recent
               years. In contrast to previous work that relied on the FBI's
               Supplemental Homicide Reports that were constructed from
               self-reported cases of police-involved homicide, this data set
               is less likely to be biased by police reporting practices.
               County-specific relative risk outcomes of being shot by police
               are estimated as a function of the interaction of: 1) whether
               suspects/civilians were armed or unarmed, and 2) the
               race/ethnicity of the suspects/civilians. The results provide
               evidence of a significant bias in the killing of unarmed black
               Americans relative to unarmed white Americans, in that the
               probability of being \{black, unarmed, and shot by police\} is
               about 3.49 times the probability of being \{white, unarmed, and
               shot by police\} on average. Furthermore, the results of
               multi-level modeling show that there exists significant
               heterogeneity across counties in the extent of racial bias in
               police shootings, with some counties showing relative risk
               ratios of 20 to 1 or more. Finally, analysis of police shooting
               data as a function of county-level predictors suggests that
               racial bias in police shootings is most likely to emerge in
               police departments in larger metropolitan counties with low
               median incomes and a sizable portion of black residents,
               especially when there is high financial inequality in that
               county. There is no relationship between county-level racial
               bias in police shootings and crime rates (even race-specific
               crime rates), meaning that the racial bias observed in police

  abstract = "Statisticians are increasingly posed with thought-provoking and
              even paradoxical questions, challenging our qualifications for
              entering the statistical paradises created by Big Data. By
              developing measures for data quality, this article suggests a
              framework to address such a question: ``Which one should I trust
              more: a 1\% survey with 60\% response rate or a self-reported
              administrative dataset covering 80\% of the population?'' A
              5-element Euler-formula-like identity shows that for any dataset
              of size n, probabilistic or not, the difference between the
              sample average X n and the population average X N is the product
              of three terms: (1) a data quality measure, $\rho$ R,X , the
              correlation between X j and the response/recording indicator R j
              ; (2) a data quantity measure, $\surd$ (N − n)/n, where N is the
              population size; and (3) a problem difficulty measure, $\sigma$ X
              , the standard deviation of X. This decomposition provides
              multiple insights: (I) Probabilistic sampling ensures high data
              quality by controlling $\rho$ R,X at the level of N −1/2 ; (II)
              When we lose this control , the impact of N is no longer canceled
              by $\rho$ R,X , leading to a Law of Large Populations (LLP), that
              is, our estimation error, relative to the benchmarking rate 1/
              $\surd$ n, increases with $\surd$ N; and (III) the ``bigness'' of
              such Big Data (for population inferences) should be measured by
              the relative size f = n/N , not the absolute size n; (IV) When
              combining data sources for population inferences , those
              relatively tiny but higher quality ones should be given far more
              weights than suggested by their sizes. Estimates obtained from
              the Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES) of the 2016
              US presidential election suggest a $\rho$ R,X $\approx$ −0.005
              for self-reporting to vote for Donald Trump. Because of LLP, this
              seemingly minuscule data defect correlation implies that the
              simple sample proportion of the self-reported voting preference
              for Trump from 1\% of the US eligible voters, that is, n
              $\approx$ 2,300,000, has the same mean squared error as the
              corresponding sample proportion from a genuine simple random
              sample of size n $\approx$ 400, a 99.98\% reduction of sample
              size (and hence our confidence). The",

              on prejudice, scholars have neglected other racial attitudes that
              might be relevant to whites' political preferences. Our project
              addresses this omission by exploring how American politics is
              affected by white collective guilt-defined as remorse that a
              white person experiences due to her group's actions toward black
              people. We expect collective guilt to motivate white support for
              both policies perceived to benefit African Americans and black
              politicians; we also theorize conditions under which collective
              guilt is uniquely activated. We examine these expectations using
              original data from five national surveys, including two embedded
              experiments. The results reveal that collective guilt has
              considerable explanatory power, even after taking standard
              measures of racial attitudes into account. We conclude that

              American adults, we show that frames encouraging individuals to
              consider political problems in dispositional terms prompt
              populist expressions, while an encouragement to consider these
              same problems situationally does not. In our second experiment,
              we connect this framing change to voting intentions and find that
              subjects exposed to dispositional frames are more likely to
              express support for Donald Trump and less likely to express
              support for Hillary Clinton than subjects exposed to situational
              frames. We find the same pattern when we compare Bernie Sanders

              Importantly, the impact is contingent on preexisting populist
              attitudes; subjects with lower populist attitudes are more likely

              studies of public opinion from the late 1980s in a top-down model
              of opinion formation and change. The core feature of this
              synthesis, the Receive-Accept-Sample (RAS) model, remains sound,
              but the book overstates the importance of the form of public
              opinion that it explains-elite-induced survey statements of issue
              positions-and understates the force of opinions that elites
              cannot easily shape and that citizens may not be able to
              articulate in response to survey prompts. Moreover, there are
              major problems in the book's Parable of Purple Land. What, then,
              becomes of the top-down view of elite-mass interaction outlined

              characterizing the kinds of opinions Nature and Origins leaves
              out: Converse's ``group interest'' voters, ``nature of the
              times'' voters, and issue publics. I then add a model of
              political parties as policy-motivated organizers of Converse's
              voter types. The upshot is an account of elite/mass interactions
              that is still largely top-down and that has roles for both the
              elite-led attitudes that the RAS model explains and the less
              conventional and harder-to-shape attitudes that it overlooks.

               reflected in the volume of work examining gender gaps in public
               opinion and partisan choice. Despite their centrality, sex and
               gender are poorly measured in survey research. The principal
               problem is the conflation of gender with sex in survey research.
               Consequently, gender is typically treated as a dichotomy, with
               no response options for androgynous gender identities, or indeed
               degrees of identification with masculine or feminine identities.
               We compare a new measure of genuine gender identification with a
               conventional measure of biological sex to determine whether the
               practice of using sex as a proxy for gender is sound. Sex is a
               fair proxy for gender, but for about a quarter of our sample, it

              central to government responsiveness and democratic policy
              making. While previous research on political behavior has
              explored the influence of collective economic conditions ,
              self-interested explanations have heavily swayed work on policy
              preferences. We bridge these two previously distinct literatures
              to articulate a theory of public policy preferences that
              highlights when both common and pocketbook factors influence
              preferences for social insurance. Using a cross-national sample
              of developed democracies from 1996 and 2006, we conclude that
              when personal economic conditions are dire, the pull of
              self-interest trumps both collective and policy concerns. W hat
              affects individuals' policy preferences remains a key question
              that connects fundamental aspects of democratic governance:
              public opinion, government responsiveness, and policy making. An
              important theoretical aspect of this relationship between
              individuals and their government has been the connection between
              the public policies governments create and the public's attitudes
              toward those policies. Although scholars have debated how
              pocketbook (personal) and sociotropic (collective) interests can
              shape political opinion and behavior, we consider whether these
              interests shape individuals' policy preferences by defining the
              stakes they face within a policy environment. Explanations of
              individual political behavior and opinion point to the influences
              of both personal and collective interests. Although arguments of
              self-interest as a driving influence on behavior have shaped
              theories in social science, the empirical evidence has been less
              decisive (Lynch and Myrskyla 2009; Sears and Funk 1990, 1991). In
              distinguishing between sources of economic concern, scholars have
              shown how common experiences can influence individual political
              attitudes and behavior more so than personal concerns (Duch and
              Stevenson 2008; Mutz 1998; Singer and Carlin 2013), highlighting
              the importance of collective circumstances. While theories of
              political behavior more broadly have come to recognize the
              importance of collective interests, research on public policy
              attitudes and preferences has maintained an emphasis on the role
              of self-interest and individual insecurity (Baslevent and
              Kirmanoglu 2011; Chong, Citrin, and Conley 2001; Mutz 1998). From
              a focus on the effect of income (Meltzer and Richard 1981),
              scholars have branched into theorizing about how the risk of
              unemployment shapes preferences for government assistance

               rapidly, and so too has an extensive literature on natives'
               attitudes toward immigration. This research has developed from
               two theoretical foundations, one grounded in political economy,
               the other in political psychology. These two literatures have
               developed largely in isolation from one another, yet the
               conclusions that emerge from each are strikingly similar.
               Consistently, immigration attitudes show little evidence of
               being strongly correlated with personal economic circumstances.
               Instead, research finds that immigration attitudes are shaped by
               sociotropic concerns about its cultural impacts-and to a lesser
               extent its economic impacts-on the nation as a whole. This
               pattern of results has held up as scholars have increasingly
               turned to experimental tests, and it holds for the United
               States, Canada, and Western Europe. Still, more work is needed

               seek out and be attracted to threatening information. In an

               information in a website designed to mimic online news sources.
               The website has both immigration and nonimmigration stories, and

               explain the empirics of mass political behavior. But their model

               Second, concerns about group economics, status, and respect are

              Since their emergence in the 1930s, opinion polls---or
              surveys---have become the dominant way to assess the public will.
              But even given the long history of polling, there is no agreement
              among political scientists on how to best measure public opinion
              through polls. This article is a call for political scientists to
              be more self-conscious about the choices we make when we attempt
              to measure public opinion with surveys in two realms. I first
              take up the question of whom to interview, discussing the major
              challenges survey researchers face when sampling respondents from
              the population of interest. I then discuss the level of
              specificity with which we can properly collect information about
              the political preferences of individuals. I focus on the types of

              or opposes their candidate expectations. Normatively, new
              negative information about a preferred candidate should result in
              a downward adjustment of an existing evaluation. However, recent
              studies show exactly the opposite; voters become more supportive
              of a preferred candidate in the face of negatively valenced
              information. Motivated reasoning is advanced as the explanation,
              arguing that people are psychologically motivated to maintain and
              support existing evaluations. Yet it seems unlikely that voters
              do this ad infinitum. To do so would suggest continued motivated
              reasoning even in the face of extensive disconfirming
              information. In this study we consider whether motivated
              reasoning processes can be overcome simply by continuing to

              We also show that as this tipping point is reached, anxiety

              that the Affordable Care Act would create ``death panels.''
              Participants from an opt-in Internet panel were randomly assigned

              and strong opposition to the reform bill among those who view
              Palin unfavorably and those who view her favorably but have low

              often an academic institution, in the initial consent form and/or
              on the survey website itself. It is an open question whether
              these displays of academic survey sponsorship could increase
              total survey error. We measure the extent to which sponsorship
              (by a university or marketing firm) affects data quality,

              socially desirable responding. In addition, we examine whether

               little to affect attitudes toward immigration, even though it

               This is true even when people's misperceptions are explicitly

               independent variables, but some research argues that using LDVs
               in regressions produces negatively biased coefficient estimates,
               even if the LDV is part of the data-generating process. I
               demonstrate that these concerns are easily resolved by
               specifying a regression model that accounts for autocorrelation
               in the error term. This actually implies that more LDV and
               lagged independent variables should be included in the
               specification, not fewer. Including the additional lags yields
               more accurate parameter estimates, which I demonstrate using the
               same data-generating process scholars had previously used to
               argue against including LDVs. I use Monte Carlo simulations to
               show that this specification returns much more accurate
               coefficient estimates for independent variables (across a wide
               range of parameter values) than alternatives considered in
               earlier research. The simulation results also indicate that
               improper exclusion of LDVs can lead to severe bias in
               coefficient estimates. While no panacea, scholars should
               continue to confidently include LDVs as part of a robust

               citizens to their representatives. Nonetheless, a longstanding
               concern is that partisan identification slants decision-making.
               Citizens may support (oppose) policies that they would otherwise
               oppose (support) in the absence of an endorsement from a
               political party-this is due in large part to what is called
               partisan motivated reasoning where individuals interpret
               information through the lens of their party commitment. We
               explore partisan motivated reasoning in a survey experiment
               focusing on support for an energy law. We identify two
               politically relevant factors that condition partisan motivated
               reasoning: (1) an explicit inducement to form an ``accurate''
               opinion, and (2) cross-partisan, but not consensus, bipartisan
               support for the law. We further provide evidence of how partisan
               motivated reasoning works psychologically and affects opinion

               results for understanding opinion formation and the overall

               cohabitation did not offset the growth of racially-mixed
               marriages. The past decade also ushered in unprecedented
               declines in intermarriage with whites and large increases in
               marriage between native- and foreign-born co-ethnics among
               Hispanics and Asian Americans. The role of educational
               attainment in the out-marriage patterns of Hispanics and Asian
               Americans was also reinforced. Any evidence of differential
               growth in African American-white marriages among the highly
               educated African American population was weak. If intermarriage
               is our guide, any shifting, blurring, or crossing of
               racial/ethnic boundaries represent uncommonly weak mechanisms
               for breaking down existing racial barriers to black-white union

               of two main threads: ( a) an effort to invent new policies using
               insights from the social and behavioral science consensus about

               trials. We argue that the problems of each approach may be
               solved or at least well addressed by teams that combine the two.
               We also suggest that governmental actors ought to want to learn
               about why a new policy works as much as they want to know that
               the policy works. We envision a future evidence-informed public

               The new racism, referred to as ``symbolic racism'' or, more
               recently, ``racial resentment,'' by contrast, is defined as a

  author    = "Craemer, Thomas",
  abstract  = "In a democratic political system, where decisions are made by
               majority rule, the permanent exclusion of minorities is always a
               possibility. This raises a crucial question: what psychological
               mechanisms may allow members of a majority to identify with the
               political goals of a minority group? One possibility is that
               they are precisely the same mechanisms responsible for
               motivating minority members themselves to identify with the
               minority's political goals. According to the racial attitudes
               literature, African Americans are motivated by feelings of
               closeness toward Blacks to support pro-Black policies. This
               study investigates the possibility that feelings of closeness
               toward Blacks may also motivate White Americans to support
               pro-Black policies. To circumvent possible social desirability
               effects often associated with questions of race, feelings of
               closeness are measured both on the conscious (explicit) and
               nonconscious (implicit) levels. The implicit closeness measure
               is based on the idea of ``cognitive self-other overlap'' (Aron,
               Aron, Tudor, \& Nelson, 1991) and has previously been used to
               measure nonconscious feelings of closeness in individual
               relationships. This study represents an application of this
               measure to the group level of racial intergroup relations. The
               study is based on a sample of 555 college students of diverse
               racial backgrounds. Results of a Granger-causality test support
               the construct validity of the implicit closeness measure.
               Furthermore, explicit and implicit feelings of closeness toward
               African Americans predict pro-Black policy support whether White

               of other backgrounds. Political and methodological implications

              In this elegantly written and innovative book, Paul Sniderman and
              Edward Carmines illuminate aspects of white Americans' thinking
              about the politics of race previously hidden from sight. And in a
              thoughtful follow-up analysis, they point the way toward public
              policies that could gain wide support and reduce the gap between
              black and white Americans. Their discoveries will surprise
              pollsters and policymakers alike. The authors show that
              prejudice, although by no means gone, has lost its power to
              dominate the political thinking of white Americans. Concentrating
              on the new race-conscious agenda, they introduce a method of
              hidden measurement which reveals that liberals are just as angry
              over affirmative action as conservatives and that racial
              prejudice, while more common among conservatives, is more
              powerful in shaping the political thinking of liberals. They also
              find that the good will many whites express for blacks is not
              feigned but represents a genuine regard for blacks, which they
              will stand by even when given a perfectly acceptable excuse to
              respond negatively to blacks. More crucially, Sniderman and
              Carmines show that the current impasse over race can be overcome
              if we remember what we once knew. The strongest arguments in
              behalf of equality for black Americans reach beyond race to the

               overlooked the potential of candidate occupational cues. This
               article uses experimental survey data conducted by the Los

               competence or qualifications for the office in question. As the

               experiments. While experimental research designs have
               contributed much to the analysis of political stereotypes and
               heuristics, the extent to which experi- mental research on this
               hypothesis is externally valid is open to question. Moreover,
               experimental approaches are notwell-suited to estimating the
               magnitude of the effects of stereotypes in real-world
               situations, especially in the context of complex political phe-
               nomena such as election campaigns. In this article, I develop a
               statistical model of the effects of race on perceptions of

               on political issues are to an important extent driven by an
               underlying conservative-liberal ideological dimension.
               Self-identification as conservative vs. liberal is regarded as a
               marker of this dimension. However, past research has not
               thoroughly distinguished between ideological identity (a
               self-categorization) and ideology (an integrated value system).
               This research evaluates the thesis that conservative-liberal
               identity functions as a readiness to adopt beliefs and attitudes
               about newly politicized issues that one is told are consistent
               with the socially prescribed meaning of conservatism-liberalism.
               In Study 1, conservative-liberal identity, measured in 2000, had
               an independent prospective effect on support for invading Iraq
               in 2002 and support for the Iraq war in 2004, controlling for
               substantive ideology, party identity, and demographics. In Study
               2, conservative- and liberal-identifiers adopted stances on farm
               subsidy policy based on randomly varied cues indicating which
               ideological group supports which stance. This cue-based
               influence was mediated by adoption of attitude-supportive
               beliefs. Discussion addresses the joint impact of political
               discourse and identity-based social influence on the
               organization of political attitudes. \copyright{} 2010 Springer

               registration records from Florida, where self-reported ethnicity

               respectively, while maintaining the true positive rate above

               for how motives might influence behavior in several important
               domains; two additional papers focus on specific motives that
               can guide motivated reasoning: Russell Golman, George
               Loewenstein, Karl Ove Moene, and Luca Zarri discuss how a
               ``preference for belief consonance'' leads people to try to

               others, and Francesca Gino, Michael Norton, and Roberto Weber

              Current empirical practice tends to overlook two important

               Intra-individual correlations on linked fate items are very

               points to partisan segmentation in the contemporary news market,
               but while assumptions abound, the mechanism driving consumers to
               sort along party lines is unclear. I develop a framework for
               news choice based on perceptions of objectivity and credibility
               and report a test of its central mechanism using a nationally
               representative survey experiment. I find support for a congenial
               media effect, where news content from an unfamiliar source is
               seen as more credible and less biased when it is consistent with
               existing beliefs, while balanced news content may be dismissed
               as less credible and biased. Previous studies have examined how
               perceptions of bias in identical news content can change when it
               is attributed to different sources. In today's media world
               however, access to more news sources generally and the ease with

              2003). For students preparing for work on a Ph.D. degree in
              statistics and instructors of mathematical statistics courses,
              this useful book provides solutions to train students for their
              research ability in mathematical statistics and presents many
              additional results and examples that complement any text in
              mathematical statistics. To develop problem-solving skills, two
              solutions and/or notes of brief discussions accompany a few
              exercises. The exercises are grouped into seven chapters with
              titles matching those in the author's Mathematical Statistics. On
              the other hand, the book is stand-alone because exercises and
              solutions are comprehensible independently of their source, and
              notation and terminology are explained in the front of the book.
              Readers are assumed to have a good knowledge in advanced
              calculus. A course in real analysis or measure theory is highly
              recommended. If this book is used with a statistics textbook that
              does not include probability theory, then knowledge in
              measure-theoretic probability theory is required. \copyright{}

               critique by taking a more expansive view of what constitutes
               political knowledge. Using data from a large Canadian urban

               knowledge, such as government benefits and services. Our results
               also demonstrate that this type of knowledge is more equally
               distributed than its conventional counterpart, though the women
               who are the most likely to need government services and benefits
               are often the least likely to know about them. Finally, we show
               that knowledge of government services and benefits has a
               significant effect on women's intended vote choice. This article
               thus shows that more practical types of political knowledge

               States. What is yet to be tested is whether the measures
               employed adequately capture the multidimensional theoretical
               constructs associated with group consciousness across racial and
               ethnic populations. To address this question, we make use of the
               2004 National Political Study (N = 3,339) and apply principal
               components analysis and exploratory factor analysis to assess

              favorability toward complex, multidimensional objects, such as
              candidates or policies. Most conjoints rely upon a fully
              randomized design to generate average marginal component effects
              (AMCEs). They measure the degree to which a given value of a
              conjoint profile feature increases, or decreases, respondents'
              support for the overall profile relative to a baseline, averaging
              across all respondents and other features. While the AMCE has a
              clear causal interpretation (about the effect of features), most
              published conjoint analyses also use AMCEs to describe levels of

              across groups after controlling for their overall level of the
              latent trait of interest. Using a multi-group confirmatory factor
              analysis of knowledge items drawn from American National Election
              Studies, we find that the scales used in recent research are not
              sufficiently invariant for valid comparisons across a host of
              theoretically important grouping variables. We demonstrate that
              it is possible to construct valid invariant scales using a subset
              of items and show the impact of invariance by comparing results
              from the valid and invalid scales. We provide an analysis of
              differential item functioning based on grouping variables
              commonly used in political science research to explore the
              utility of each item in the construction of valid knowledge
              scales. An application of the VTT suggests it is more appropriate
              to conceive of these items as effects of a latent variable rather
              than cause or formative indicators. These results suggest that
              models attempting to explain apparent knowledge gaps between
              subgroups have been unsuccessful because previously constructed
              scales were validated by fiat.",

              observations. We argue that this pre-aggregation is less

              addressing measurement error inherent in event data. Therefore,
              we advocate that data should be supplied and analyzed at the

               Empirical studies have shown that homophily, i.e., greater
               interaction between like-minded individuals, results in
               polarization. However, we show that DeGroot's well-known model
               of opinion formation based on repeated averaging can never be
               polarizing, even if individuals are arbitrarily homophilous. We
               generalize DeGroot's model to account for a phenomenon well
               known in social psychology as biased assimilation: When
               presented with mixed or inconclusive evidence on a complex

               opinion formation process results in polarization if individuals
               are sufficiently biased. In other words, homophily alone,
               without biased assimilation, is not sufficient to polarize

               electoral outcomes, but we know little about civic participation
               among Black LGBT people. Although decades of research on
               political participation has made it almost an article of faith
               that members of dominant groups (such as White people and
               individuals of higher socioeconomic status) vote at higher rates
               than their less privileged counterparts, recent work has
               suggested that there are circumstances under which members of
               marginalized groups might participate at higher rates. Some of
               this research suggests that political participation might also
               increase when groups perceive elections as particularly
               threatening. We argue that when such threats are faced by
               marginalized groups, the concern to protect hard-earned rights
               can activate a sense of what we call ``political
               hypervigilance,'' and that such effects may be particularly
               pronounced among members of intersectionally-marginalized groups
               such as LGBT African Americans. To test this theory, we use
               original data from the 2016 National Survey on HIV in the Black
               Community, a nationally-representative survey of Black
               Americans, to explore the relationship among same-sex sexual
               behavior, attitudes toward LGBT people, and respondent voting
               intentions in the 2016 presidential election. We find that
               respondents who reported having engaged in same-sex sexual
               behavior were strongly and significantly more likely to say they
               ``definitely will vote'' compared to respondents who reported no
               same-sex sexual behavior. More favorable views of LGBT
               individuals and issues (marriage equality) were also associated
               with greater intention to vote. We argue that these high rates
               provide preliminary evidence that political hypervigilance can,
               in fact, lead to increased political engagement among members of
               marginalized groups.",

  author   = "Stevenson, Megan",
  abstract = "Recent years have seen a rush towards evidence-based tools in
              criminal justice. As part of this movement, many jurisdictions
              have adopted actuarial risk assessment to supplement or replace
              the ad-hoc decisions of judges. Proponents of risk assessment
              tools claim that they can dramatically reduce incarceration
              without harming public safety. Critics claim that risk assessment
              will exacerbate racial disparities. Despite extensive and heated
              rhetoric, there is virtually no evidence on how use of this
              ``evidence-based'' tool affects key outcomes such as
              incarceration rates, crime, or racial disparities. The research
              discussing what ``should'' happen as a result of risk assessment
              is hypothetical and largely ignores the complexities of
              implementation. This Article is one of the first studies to
              document the impacts of risk assessment in practice. It evaluates
              pretrial risk assessment in Kentucky, a state that was an early
              adopter of risk assessment and is often cited as an example of
              best-practices in the pretrial area. Using rich data on more than
              one million criminal cases, the paper shows that a 2011 law
              making risk assessment a mandatory part of the bail decision led
              to a significant change in bail setting practice, but only a
              small increase in pretrial release. These changes eroded over
              time as judges returned to their previous habits. Furthermore,
              the increase in releases was not cost-free: failures-to-appear
              and pretrial crime increased as well. Risk assessment had no
              effect on racial disparities in pretrial detention once differing
              regional trends were accounted for. Kentucky's experience does
              not mean we should abandon risk assessment, but it should temper
              the hyperbolic hopes (and fears) about its effects. Risk
              assessment in practice is different from risk assessment in the
              abstract, and its impacts depend on context and details of
              implementation. If indeed risk assessment is capable of producing
              large benefits, it will take research and experimentation to
              learn how to achieve them. Such a process would be evidence-based
              criminal justice at its best: not a flocking towards methods that
              bear the glossy veneer of science, but a careful and iterative
              evaluation of what works and what does not.",

               or an intention to be more politically active, and if those
               effects vary by gender and partisan identity. Using a
               nationally-representative panel study of adolescents and their
               parents, we find that Democratic girls became more pessimistic
               about the responsiveness of the American political system in the
               wake of 2016. Democratic girls in general became substantially

               likely to engage in protest after 2016 also encouraged more
               interest in protest among adolescents. We view these outcomes as

               well? Focusing on state welfare reform in the mid-1990s, we test
               hypotheses derived from two alternative approaches to
               incorporating gender into the study of representation and
               welfare policymaking. An additive approach, which assumes gender
               and race/ethnicity are distinct and independent, suggests that
               female state legislators---regardless of race/ethnicity---will
               mitigate the more restrictive and punitive aspects of welfare
               reform, much like their African American and Latino counterparts
               do. In contrast, an intersectional approach, which highlights
               the overlapping and interdependent nature of gender and
               race/ethnicity, suggests that legislative women of color will
               have the strongest countervailing effect on state welfare
               reform---stronger than that of other women or men of color. Our
               empirical analyses suggest an intersectional approach yields a
               more accurate understanding of gender, race/ethnicity, and
               welfare politics in the states.",

               modeling repeated observations and permits a simple Bonferroni

               investigating the role of attitude-based motivated reasoning in

              prediction by race and gender of one pretrial risk assessment,
              the Public Safety Assessment (PSA). The PSA was developed with
              support from the Laura and John Arnold Foundation (LJAF) to
              reduce the burden placed on vulnerable populations at the
              frontend of the criminal justice system. The growing and
              disparate use of incarceration is one of the most pressing social
              issues facing the U.S. Although it has received less attention,
              pretrial populations are a large and growing contributor of mass
              incarceration. The pretrial phase is often said to be the most
              consequential in the criminalizing process because it is related
              a higher likelihood of conviction, longer terms of incarceration,
              and has the potential to destabilize families. Recognizing the
              inherent challenges in pretrial release decisions, there has been
              increased development and use of pretrial risk assessments.
              Pretrial risk assessments are developed to identify the
              likelihood that defendants will remain crime free and that they
              will return to court. There have been several critiques of risk
              assessments, but none have assessed differential validity or
              prediction using pretrial outcomes. Using a statewide dataset
              from Kentucky (n = 164,597) we found the PSA to have predictive
              validity measures in line with what are generally accepted within
              the criminal justice field. We applied a regression modeling
              approach commonly used to assess bias in test instruments (e.g.,
              cognitive and employment testing), and found some instances of
              differential prediction by race. These differences suggest that
              the PSA scores to predict failure to appear (FTA) are moderated
              by race, with no significant differences found for new crimes and
              new violent crimes between black and white defendants. The
              findings show differential prediction for new violent criminal
              arrests between male and female defendants, similar to what was
              found by Skeem et al. (2016). In the end, we point to data
              limitations that weaken external validity, point to areas for
              future research, and suggest that risk assessments are not silver
              bullets, but rather decision-making tools that require ongoing
              refinement.",

              The results show that the impact of uncorrelated measurement
              error on the principal component scores is mainly in terms of
              increased variability and not bias. In practice, the

              group-based affect/antagonisms-are more crystallized than mass

  abstract = "Social scientists generally enjoy substantial latitude in
              selecting measures and models for hypothesis testing. Coupled
              with publication and related biases, this latitude raises the
              concern that researchers may intentionally or unintentionally
              select models that yield positive findings, leading to an
              unreliable body of published research. To combat this ``fishing''
              problem in medical studies, leading journals now require
              preregistration of designs that emphasize the prior
              identification of dependent and independent variables. However,
              we demonstrate here that even with this level of advanced
              specification, the scope for fishing is considerable when there
              is latitude over selection of covariates, subgroups, and other
              elements of an analysis plan. These concerns could be addressed
              through the use of a form of comprehensive registration. We
              experiment with such an approach in the context of an ongoing
              field experiment for which we drafted a complete ``mock report''
              of findings using fake data on treatment assignment. We describe
              the advantages and disadvantages of this form of registration and
              propose that a comprehensive but nonbinding approach be adopted
              as a first step to combat fishing by social scientists. Likely
              effects of comprehensive but nonbinding registration are
              discussed, the principal advantage being communication rather
              than commitment, in particular that it generates a clear
              distinction between exploratory analyses and genuine tests.

               Although asymptotically consistent, CRVE can be biased downward
               when the number of clusters is small, leading to hypothesis
               tests with rejection rates that are too high. More accurate
               tests can be constructed using bias-reduced linearization (BRL),
               which corrects the CRVE based on a working model, in conjunction

              access by race and income-disparities that financial aid and

               model with a p th-order autoregressive error process to analyze
               unbalanced binary time-series cross-sectional (TSCS) data. The
               model specification is motivated by the generic TSCS data
               structure and is intended to handle the associated inefficiency
               and endogeneity problems. It accommodates heterogeneity across
               units and between time periods in the form of random intercepts
               and random-effect coefficients. At the same time, its p th-order
               autoregressive error process, employed either by itself or in
               concert with other dynamic methods, adequately corrects serial
               correlation and improves statistical inference and forecasting.
               With a stationarity restriction on the error process, the model
               can also be used as a residual-based cointegration test on
               discrete TSCS data. This is especially valuable because
               cointegration testing on discrete TSCS data is methodologically
               challenging and rarely conducted in practice. To handle the
               estimation difficulties, I developed an efficient Markov chain
               Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm by orthogonalizing the error term
               with the Cholesky decomposition and adding an auxiliary

               move---multigrid Monte Carlo updating (PGM-MGMC), is employed to

               inquiry in political science. When treatment data are either
               nonrandomly assigned or missing, the analyst will often invoke
               ignorability assumptions: that is, both the treatment and
               missingness are assumed to be as if randomly assigned, perhaps
               conditional on a set of observed covariates. But what if these
               assumptions are wrong? What if the analyst does not know why-or
               even if-a particular subject received a treatment? Building on
               Manski, Molinari offers an approach for calculating
               nonparametric identification bounds for the average treatment
               effect of a binary treatment under general missingness or

               positive). Given the potential importance of these assumptions,
               we develop a new Bayesian method for performing sensitivity

              modeling time dependence in binary data has been to incorporate
              time dummies or splined time in logistic regressions. Although we
              agree with the need for modeling time dependence, we demonstrate
              that time dummies can induce estimation problems due to
              separation. Splines do not suffer from these problems. However,
              the complexity of splines has led substantive researchers (1) to
              use knot values that may be inappropriate for their data and (2)
              to ignore any substantive discussion concerning temporal
              dependence. We propose a relatively simple alternative: including
              t, t2, and t3 in the regression. This cubic polynomial
              approximation is trivial to implement-and, therefore,
              interpret-and it avoids problems such as quasi-complete
              separation. Monte Carlo analysis demonstrates that, for the types
              of hazards one often sees in substantive research, the polynomial
              approximation always outperforms time dummies and generally
              performs as well as splines or even more flexible autosmoothing
              procedures. Due to its simplicity, this method also accommodates
              nonproportional hazards in a straightforward way. We reanalyze

  abstract = "Even before the sharp downturn that began in 2007, many Americans
              were concerned about economic risks. Yet this widespread public
              concern has not been matched by attention from political
              scientists regarding how citizens experience and understand the
              economic risks they face or how those experiences and
              understandings shape their views of public policy. We develop
              here an argument about the role of personal economic experiences
              in the formation of policy attitudes that we validate using a
              distinctive opinion survey of our own design, fielded not long
              after the onset of the Great Recession. The survey tracks
              citizens' economic experiences, expectations, and policy
              attitudes within multiple domains of risk (employment, medical
              care, family, and wealth arrangements). These investigations show
              that economic insecurity systematically and substantially affects
              citizens' attitudes toward government's role. Citizens' economic
              worries largely track exposure to substantial economic shocks.
              Citizens' policy attitudes in turn appear highly responsive to
              economic worries, as well as to the experience of economic
              shocks-with worries and shocks creating greater support for
              government policies that buffer the relevant economic risk.
              Attitudes seem most affected by temporally proximate shocks,
              shocks befalling households that have weak private safety nets,
              and shocks occurring within the domain most relevant to the
              policy in question, though attitudes are also (more weakly)
              correlated with shocks in other domains. The magnitude of these
              associations rivals partisanship and ideology and almost always
              exceeds that for conventional measures of socio-economic status.
              Given the long-term increase in economic insecurity and current
              sluggish recovery, understanding how insecurity shapes citizens'
              policy attitudes and political behavior should be a major concern

  abstract = "It is well known among researchers and practitioners that
              election polls suffer from a variety of sampling and non-sampling
              errors, often collectively referred to as total survey error.
              Reported margins of error typically only capture sampling
              variability, and in particular, generally ignore non-sampling
              errors in defining the target popula-tion (e.g., errors due to
              uncertainty in who will vote). Here we empirically analyze 4,221
              polls for 608 state-level presidential, senatorial, and
              gubernatorial elections be-tween 1998 and 2014, all of which were
              conducted during the final three weeks of the campaigns.
              Comparing to the actual election outcomes, we find that average
              survey error as measured by root mean square error (RMSE) is
              approximately 3.5 percentage points, about twice as large as that
              implied by most reported margins of error. Using hierarchical
              Bayesian latent variable models, we decompose survey error into
              election-level bias and variance terms. We find average absolute
              election-level bias is about 1.5 percentage points, indicating
              that polls for a given election often share a common com-ponent
              of error. This shared error may stem from the fact that polling
              organizations often face similar difficulties in reaching various
              subgroups of the population, and rely on similar screening rules
              when estimating who will vote. We further find that aver-age
              election-level variance is higher than what most reported margins
              of error would suggest. We conclude by discussing how these
              results may partially explain polling failures in the 2016 U.S.

              consequences for both. This is especially critical given that
              frames can have divergent effects on attitudes and behavior.
              Using a combination of field and survey experiments, we apply our
              approach to evaluate two frames related to climate change risks.
              We find that they heighten people's concern about climate change
              yet decrease their rate of political action to express that
              concern. Our results suggest caution with regard to these frames
              in particular and that, more generally, frames that might seem
              advantageous when examining public opinion may not be when

  abstract = "Unmeasured confounding may undermine the validity of causal
              inference with observational studies. Sensitivity analysis
              provides an attractive way to partially circumvent this issue by
              assessing the potential influence of unmeasured confounding on
              causal conclusions. However, previous sensitivity analysis
              approaches often make strong and untestable assumptions such as
              having an unmeasured confounder that is binary, or having no
              interaction between the effects of the exposure and the
              confounder on the outcome, or having only one unmeasured
              confounder. Without imposing any assumptions on the unmeasured
              confounder or confounders, we derive a bounding factor and a
              sharp inequality such that the sensitivity analysis parameters
              must satisfy the inequality if an unmeasured confounder is to
              explain away the observed effect estimate or reduce it to a
              particular level. Our approach is easy to implement and involves
              only two sensitivity parameters. Surprisingly, our bounding
              factor, which makes no simplifying assumptions, is no more
              conservative than a number of previous sensitivity analysis
              techniques that do make assumptions. Our new bounding factor
              implies not only the traditional cornfield conditions that both
              the relative risk of the exposure on the confounder and that of
              the confounder on the outcome must satisfy but also a high
              threshold that the maximum of these relative risks must satisfy.
              Furthermore, this new bounding factor can be viewed as a measure
              of the strength of confounding between the exposure and the
              outcome induced by a confounder.",

  abstract = "When outcomes are missing for reasons beyond an investigator's
              control, there are two different ways to adjust a parameter
              estimate for covariates that may be related both to the outcome
              and to missingness. One approach is to model the relationships
              between the covariates and the outcome and use those
              relationships to predict the missing values. Another is to model
              the probabilities of missingness given the covariates and
              incorporate them into a weighted or stratified estimate. Doubly
              robust (DR) procedures apply both types of model simultaneously
              and produce a consistent estimate of the parameter if either of
              the two models has been correctly specified. In this article, we
              show that DR estimates can be constructed in many ways. We
              compare the performance of various DR and non-DR estimates of a
              population mean in a simulated example where both models are
              incorrect but neither is grossly misspecified. Methods that use
              inverse-probabilities as weights, whether they are DR or not, are
              sensitive to misspecification of the propensity model when some
              estimated propensities are small. Many DR methods perform better
              than simple inverse-probability weighting. None of the DR methods
              we tried, however, improved upon the performance of simple
              regression-based prediction of the missing values. This study

              practice. But it does demonstrate that, in at least some

              and the range of implicit cues powerful enough to produce this
              effect is still unknown. In an experiment, we tested whether
              subtle racial cues embedded in political advertisements prime
              racial attitudes as predictors of candidate preference by making
              them more accessible in memory. Results show that a wide range of
              implicit race cues can prime racial attitudes and that cognitive
              accessibility mediates the effect. Furthermore,
              counter-stereotypic cues-especially those implying blacks are
              deserving of government resources-dampen racial priming,
              suggesting that the meaning drawn from the visual/narrative
              pairing in an advertisement, and not simply the presence of black
              images, triggers the effect.",

  abstract  = "Previous research has consistently documented a hostile media
               effect in which people see bias in balanced reporting on
               political controversies. In the contemporary fragmented media
               environment, partisan news outlets intentionally report
               political news from ideological perspectives, raising the
               possibility that ideologically biased news may cause viewers to
               become increasingly suspicious of and antagonistic toward news
               media---which we call oppositional media hostility. However, the
               fragmented media environment also gives television viewers ample
               opportunities to tune out news outlets with which they disagree
               as well as the news altogether, and this should moderate
               oppositional media hostility. We investigate the effects of
               partisan news shows on media perceptions across six
               laboratory-based experiments. We find that counterattitudinal
               news programming is more likely to induce hostile media
               perceptions than proattitudinal programming, but that the
               presence of choice blunts oppositional media hostility. We
               explore possible mechanisms that underlie the moderating effects
               of selective exposure. T he widespread availability of cable and
               satellite television, which reaches 91\% of American households
               (TVB 2010), has greatly expanded the news and entertainment
               options available to citizens. As of 2008, the average American
               household could choose from among 119 channels, which is more
               than six times the average number of channels available in 1985
               (Nielsen 2008) and 40 times the number of channels available
               prior to the rise of cable television. This expansion of choice
               has helped bring about the fragmentation of the television news
               media (Prior 2007) and the stratification of cable news networks
               along ideological lines (Coe et al. 2008; Groseclose and Milyo
               2005; Morris 2005; Mullainathan and Shleifer 2005). The

              several factors, each with multiple levels, are randomized to
              form a large number of possible treatment combinations. Examples
              of such experiments include conjoint analysis, which is often
              used by social scientists to analyze multidimensional preferences
              in a population. To characterize the structure of causal
              interaction in factorial experiments, we propose a new causal
              interaction effect, called the average marginal interaction
              effect (AMIE). Unlike the conventional interaction effect, the
              relative magnitude of the AMIE does not depend on the choice of
              baseline conditions, making its interpretation intuitive even for
              higher-order interactions. We show that the AMIE can be
              nonparametrically estimated using ANOVA regression with weighted
              zero-sum constraints. Because the AMIEs are invariant to the
              choice of baseline conditions, we directly regularize them by
              collapsing levels and selecting factors within a penalized ANOVA
              framework. This regularized estimation procedure reduces false
              discovery rate and further facilitates interpretation. Finally,
              we apply the proposed methodology to the conjoint analysis of
              ethnic voting behavior in Africa and find clear patterns of
              causal interaction between politicians' ethnicity and their prior

               nonverbal and relate to the physical traits of the source such
               that attractive- and competent-looking sources have better
               success in attracting votes and policy support. Yet, are all
               nonverbal source cues similarly received irrespective of

               Specifically, we ask whether some physical traits are received
               positively by some audiences but backfire for others. Utilizing
               research on ideological stereotypes and the determinants of

               facial dominance of the source and the ideology of the receiver.
               Across five studies, we demonstrate that a dominant face is a
               winning face when the audience is conservative but backfires and
               decreases success when the audience is liberal. On the other

              married men may reflect both a tendency for more productive men
              to marry and an effect of marriage on productivity. To sort out
              these explanations, researchers have used fixed effects
              regression models for panel data to adjust for selection on
              unobserved time-invariant confounders, interpreting coefficients
              for the time-varying marriage variables as effects. However, they
              did not define these effects or give conditions under which the
              regression coefficients would warrant a causal interpretation.
              Consequently, they failed to appropriately adjust for important
              time-varying confounders and misinterpreted their results.
              Regression models for panel data with unobserved time-invariant

              appropriate methods to model their data. A basic set of treatment

              models for panel data with unobserved time-invariant confounders
              are defined and the treatment effects are reexpressed in terms of
              these models. Ignorability conditions under which the parameters

               are autocrats. This follows because the survival of political
               leaders with larger winning coalitions hinges on successful
               policy. The extra effort made by democrats provides a military
               advantage over autocrats. This makes democrats unattractive

               mobilize resources for the war effort. In addition to trying
               harder, democrats are more selective in their choice of targets.
               Because defeat is more likely to lead to domestic replacement

              Demonstration, a labor training program, on postintervention
              earnings. We use data from Lalonde's evaluation of
              nonexperimental methods that combine the treated units from a
              randomized evaluation of the NSW with nonexperimental comparison
              units drawn from survey datasets. We apply propensity score
              methods to this composite dataset and demonstrate that, relative
              to the estimators that Lalonde evaluates, propensity score
              estimates of the treatment impact are much closer to the
              experimental benchmark estimate. Propensity score methods assume
              that the variables associated with assignment to treatment are
              observed (referred to as ignorable treatment assignment, or
              selection on observables). Even under this assumption, it is
              difficult to control for differences between the treatment and
              comparison groups when they are dissimilar and when there are
              many preintervention variables. The estimated propensity score
              (the probability of assignment to treatment, conditional on
              preintervention variables) summarizes the preintervention
              variables. This offers a diagnostic on the comparability of the
              treatment and comparison groups, because one has only to compare
              the estimated propensity score across the two groups. We discuss
              several methods (such as stratification and matching) that use
              the propensity score to estimate the treatment impact. When the
              range of estimated propensity scores of the treatment and
              comparison groups overlap, these methods can estimate the
              treatment impact for the treatment group. A sensitivity analysis
              shows that our estimates are not sensitive to the specification
              of the estimated propensity score, but are sensitive to the
              assumption of selection on observables. We conclude that when the
              treatment and comparison groups overlap, and when the variables
              determining assignment to treatment are observed, these methods
              provide a means to estimate the treatment impact. Even though
              propensity score methods are not always applicable, they offer a
              diagnostic on the quality of nonexperimental comparison groups in
              terms of observable preintervention variables.",

              methods require that a separate propensity score specification be
              estimated for each treatment group-comparison group combination.
              Furthermore, a researcher should always examine the sensitivity
              of the estimated treatment effect to small changes in the
              propensity score specification; this is a useful diagnostic on
              the quality of the comparison group. When these are borne in

              mandatory sentencing laws have proliferated in recent years with
              predictable consequences for prison populations. A response to
              public demand for more severe sentencing is one of the
              justifications for mandatory sentences of imprisonment. In
              addition, politicians use mandatory sentencing legislation to
              enhance their standing in the eyes of the public. Politicians
              appear to assume that the public is strongly supportive of these
              laws, though scientifically valid surveys are never cited to
              support these assumptions. This article reviews the international
              findings from surveys that reveal that the public is deeply
              divided about mandatory sentencing. Part of the reason for this
              is that there is more support for proportional sentencing than
              for utilitarian goals, such as deterrence or incapacitation. In
              addition, survey data suggest that the electoral advantage of

               education bridge a gap between two disciplines-psychology and
               medicine. We are now discovering that many of the findings that
               we viewed as robust and central to these disciplines are
               unreplicable
               (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication\_crisis). The
               research in medicine is associated with one scientist-John
               Ioannidis, now at Stanford University. He has published several
               widely cited publications demonstrating that a number of
               ostensibly robust findings of clinical trials are not replicable
               (Ioannidis 2005a, b). In one study (2005b) he reviewed 45 highly
               cited studies; 13 had no replication studies, of the remainder,
               20 (61\%) replicated. While interesting and disturbing because
               of the real impact (positive or negative) of these interventions
               on health, the findings are likely of peripheral interest to
               educators. However, lack of replicability in psychology is much
               closer to home. There have been a number of papers and articles
               raising issues about the extent to which results in psychology
               can be replicated. At the extreme, there have been several high
               profile exposures of scientific fraud. Perhaps the most
               egregious is Diederik Stapel, a social psychologist then at
               Tilburg, who made a lifetime career of fabricating data
               (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Diederik\_Stapel). At last count
               he has been forced to retract 58 publications. One has to hope
               that such practices are rare. However a more prevalent
               occurrence is that findings that were thought to be robust
               cannot be reproduced. Some examples: Dijksterhuis et al. (2006)
               achieved fame (and the inevitable Science article Dijk-sterhuis
               and Van Olden 2006) with something called the ''Deliberation

               be employed in survey experiment analysis: should they be used?
               If so, which estimators are preferred? We offer practical
               advice, rooted in the Neyman-Rubin model, for researchers
               working with survey experimental data. We examine simple,
               efficient estimators, and give formulas for their biases and
               variances. We provide simulations that examine these estimators
               as well as real examples from experiments administered online

               population treatment effects using high-quality, broadly
               representative samples recruited by top online survey firms,
               sample quantities, which do not rely on weights, are often

               estimates did not appear to differ substantially from their
               weighted counterparts, and they avoided the substantial loss of
               statistical power that accompanies weighting. When precise
               estimates of population average treatment effects (PATE) are
               essential, we analytically show poststratifying on survey
               weights and/or covariates highly correlated with outcomes to be

              general medicine outpatient clinic at a rural tertiary care
              center associated with a medical school. PATIENTS: 470 of 511
              consecutive patients who agreed to answer a questionnaire while
              waiting for their clinic visit. Mean age was 49.1 years, 62.1\%
              were female, and 51.9\% had at least one year of education beyond
              high school. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient response to the
              choice of two equally efficacious medications for the management
              of a hypothetical serious disease. The benefit of one medication
              was stated in relative terms, the other in absolute terms.
              Patients could choose either medication alone, indicate
              indifference to the choice of medication, or choose not to
              answer. MAIN RESULTS: 56.8\% of the patients chose the medication
              whose benefit was in relative terms. 14.7\% chose the medication
              whose benefit was in absolute terms. Only 15.5\% were indifferent
              to the choice of medication. The patients preferred the
              medication whose benefit was in relative terms across a wide
              range of ages and educational levels. Further questioning
              suggested that the patients thought benefit was greater when
              expressed in relative terms because they ignored the underlying
              risk of disease and assumed it was one. CONCLUSIONS: The
              ``framing'' of benefit (or risk) in relative versus absolute
              terms may have a major influence on patient preference.",

               understanding of the difference between within and between
               effects of predictor variables is important in considering what
               modelling strategy to use. We show that the main problem of
               Random Effects modelling - endogenous variables - is in fact a
               case of omitted variable bias that is readily solvable using a
               variant of the Mundlak (1978a) formulation. Consequently, Random
               Effects modelling provides everything that Fixed Effects
               modelling promises, and much more. Crucially it allows the
               modelling of time-invariant variables, and does so in a more
               parsimonious and explicit way than an alternative, Pl{\"u}mper
               and Troegers Fixed Effects Vector Decomposition (2007). It is
               also readily extendable to a Random Coefficients Model, allowing
               reliable, differential effects of variables without heavy
               parameterisation. As such we are arguing not simply for a
               technical solution to endogeneity, but for the substantive
               importance of modelling context, and the ability of Random
               Effects modelling to do so. Our empirical examples then show
               that failing to do this can lead to very misleading results. The
               distinctive focus of this paper is the stress on the substantive
               interpretation of the within and between relations. This has

              designs. Yet, all theories of inference pro-posed to justify
              matching methods are based on simple random sampling. This is all
              the more troubling because, although these theories require exact
              matching, most matching applications resort to some form of ex
              post stratification (on a propensity score, distance metric, or
              the covariates) to find approximate matches, thus nulli-fying the
              statistical properties the theories are designed to ensure.
              Fortunately, the type of sampling used in a theory of inference
              is an axiom, rather than an assump-tion vulnerable to being

              presenting treatment benefits in different formats on the
              decisions of both patients and health professionals. Three
              formats were investigated: relative risk reductions, absolute
              risk reductions, and number needed to treat or screen. METHODS: A
              systematic review of the published literature was conducted.
              Articles were retrieved by searching a variety of databases and
              screened for inclusion by 2 reviewers. Data were extracted on
              characteristics of the subjects and methodologies used. Log-odds
              ratios were calculated to estimate effect sizes. RESULTS: A total
              of 24 articles were retrieved that reported on 31 unique
              experiments. The meta-analysis showed that treatments were
              evaluated more favorably when the relative risk format was used
              rather than the absolute risk or number needed to treat format.
              However, a significant amount of heterogeneity was found between
              studies, the sources of which were explored using subgroup
              analyses and metaregression. Although the subgroup analyses
              revealed smaller effect sizes in the studies conducted on
              physicians, the metaregression showed that these differences were
              largely accounted for by other features of the study design. Most
              notably, variations in effect sizes were explained by the
              particular wordings that the studies had chosen to use for the
              relative risk and absolute risk reductions. CONCLUSIONS: The
              published literature has consistently demonstrated that relative
              risk formats produce more favorable evaluations of treatments
              than absolute risk or number needed to treat formats. However,
              the effects are heterogeneous and seem to be moderated by key
              differences between the methodologies used.",

  abstract  = "In recent years, scientists have paid increasing attention to
               reproducibility. For example, the Reproducibility Project, a
               large-scale replication attempt of 100 studies published in top
               psychology journals found that only 39\% could be unambiguously
               reproduced. There is a growing consensus among scientists that
               the lack of reproducibility in psychology and other fields stems
               from various methodological factors, including low statistical
               power, researcher's degrees of freedom, and an emphasis on
               publishing surprising positive results. However, there is a
               contentious debate about the extent to which failures to
               reproduce certain results might also reflect contextual
               differences (often termed ``hidden moderators'') between the
               original research and the replication attempt. Although
               psychologists have found extensive evidence that contextual
               factors alter behavior, some have argued that context is
               unlikely to influence the results of direct replications
               precisely because these studies use the same methods as those
               used in the original research. To help resolve this debate, we
               recoded the 100 original studies from the Reproducibility
               Project on the extent to which the research topic of each study
               was contextually sensitive. Results suggested that the
               contextual sensitivity of the research topic was associated with
               replication success, even after statistically adjusting for
               several methodological characteristics (e.g., statistical power,
               effect size). The association between contextual sensitivity and
               replication success did not differ across psychological
               subdisciplines. These results suggest that researchers,
               replicators, and consumers should be mindful of contextual
               factors that might influence a psychological process. We offer
               several guidelines for dealing with contextual sensitivity in

               patterns in working-memory-related tasks. When experts are
               involved, studies show activations in brain regions typically
               activated during long-term memory tasks that are not observed
               with novices, a result that is compatible with functional brain
               reorganization. By contrast, when involving novices and training
               programs, studies show a decrease in brain regions typically
               activated during working memory tasks, with no functional
               reorganization. We suggest that the latter result is a
               consequence of practice periods that do not allow important
               structures to be completely acquired: knowledge structures
               (i.e., Ericsson and Kintsch's retrieval structures; Gobet and

               allow individuals to improve performance on working-memory
               tasks, by enabling them to use part of long-term memory as
               working memory, causing a cerebral functional reorganization.
               Our hypothesis is that the two brain activation patterns
               observed in the literature are not discordant, but involve the
               same process of expertise acquisition in two stages: from
               decreased activation to brain functional reorganization. The

              that of their neighbors. Using data from randomized natural field
              experiments at 600,000 treatment and control households across
              the United States, I estimate that the average program reduces
              energy consumption by 2.0\%. The program provides additional
              evidence that non-price interventions can substantially and cost
              effectively change consumer behavior: the effect is equivalent to
              that of a short-run electricity price increase of 11 to 20\%, and
              the cost effectiveness compares favorably to that of traditional
              energy conservation programs. Perhaps because the treatment
              included descriptive social norms, effects are heterogeneous:
              households in the highest decile of pre-treatment consumption

              pitfalls of policy driven by ideology or values. Critics of EBPM
              remind us that the policy process remains messy and uncertain and
              that while research may deliver the latest scientific evidence,
              it is not always translated effectively into policy. We argue

              policy-makers but because of the way in which knowledge is
              collected and communicated to policy-makers. It is well
              understood that policy actors are boundedly rational and this
              impacts upon the way in which evidence is used in the policy
              process. What has not been clearly articulated and is the focus
              of this article is that bounded rationality applies equally to
              the production of evidence. Drawing on the work of Polish

              automatically enroll their new employees in the company 401(k)
              plan. Using several years of administrative data from three large
              firms, we analyze the impact of automatic enrollment on 401(k)
              participation rates, savings behavior, and asset accumulation. We
              find that although employees can opt out of the 401(k) plan, few
              choose to do so. As a result, automatic enrollment has a dramatic
              impact on retirement savings behavior: 401(k) participation rates
              at all three firms exceed 85\%, but participants tend to anchor
              at a low default savings rate and in a conservative default
              investment vehicle. We find that initially, about 80\% of
              participants accept both the default savings rate (2\% or 3\% for
              our three companies) and the default investment fund (a stable
              value or money market fund). Even after three years, half of the
              plan participants subject to automatic enrollment continue to
              contribute at the default rate and invest their contributions
              exclusively in the default fund. The effects of automatic
              enrollment on asset accumulation are not straightforward. While
              higher participation rates promote wealth accumulation, the low
              default savings rate and the conservative default investment fund
              undercut accumulation. In our sample, these two effects are
              roughly offsetting on average. However, automatic enrollment does
              increase saving in the lower tail of the savings distribution by
              dramatically reducing the fraction of employees who do not

              their marginal electricity use, induced persistent energy savings
              behavior of 8--10\% over 100 days; whereas a more tradi-tional

               taxes or subsidies. This paper studies the optimal choice of
               policy instrument in settings characterized by such features. We
               utilize a simple binary-choice model in which decision-makers
               are either active or passive; active choosers make their
               decisions by com-paring perceived costs and benefits whereas
               passive choosers select whichever option is the default. From
               this simple model, a number of results emerge. First,
               manipulating the default option is preferable to imposing a
               mandate when active choosers tend to make correct deci-sions.
               Second, taxes and defaults are complements, not substitutes;
               employing the two types of instruments in conjunction can yield
               better results than utilizing either one alone. Finally, the
               optimal combination of taxes and defaults is typically
               preferable to a mandate even in settings where active choosers
               are prone to biases. The results establish important limits on

              When asked, they say they prefer a 'green' (i.e., environmentally
              friendly) source for this energy. Yet, although green electricity
              is available in many markets, people do not generally buy it. Why
              not? Motivated by behavioural decision research, we argue that
              the format of information presentation drastically affects the
              choice of electricity. Specifically, we hypothesise that people
              use the kind of electricity that is offered to them as the
              default. We present two natural studies and two experiments in
              the laboratory that support this hypothesis. In the two
              real-world situations, there was a green default, and most people
              used it. In the first laboratory experiment, more participants
              chose the green utility when it was the default than when 'grey'
              electricity was the default. In the second laboratory experiment,
              participants asked for more money to give up green electricity
              than they were willing to pay for it. We argue that changing
              defaults can be used to promote pro-environmental behaviour.

              Policy Implications Police officerswho are actively engaged with

              arrests and the use of force by officers can reduce public trust

              effectiveness of the eco-nomic tools traditionally deployed in
              carrying out the functions of government, which include remedying
              market failures, redistributing income, and collecting tax
              revenue. An understanding of psychology can also lead to the
              development of different policy tools that better motivate
              desired behavior change or that are more cost-effective than
              traditional policy tools. The article outlines a framework for
              thinking about the psychology of behavior change in the context
              of market fail-ures. It then describes the research on the
              effects of a variety of interven-tions rooted in an understanding
              of psychology that have policy-relevant applications. The article
              concludes by discussing how an understanding of psychology can
              also inform the use and design of traditional policy tools for
              behavior change, such as financial incentives. A lot of our
              policy models traditionally are based on a rather na{\"\i}ve
              understanding of what drives behavior. But if you have a more
              intelligent, nuanced account of how people make decisions, you
              can design policy that is more effective, less costly, and makes
              life easier for most citizens. ---David Halpern, Director of the

  abstract  = "Nudges modify decision frameworks in order to steer people's
               choices in particular directions. Modifying energy consumption
               choices through nudging has shown significant promise for
               promoting sustainable consumption behaviors. However, policy
               makers have been reluctant to embrace nudges, due to concerns
               over potential ethical objections. This paper argues that the
               major ethical objections to nudging are not ultimately
               convincing when applied to energy production and consumption.
               The most common ethical objections claim that nudging is
               paternalistic and reduces human autonomy. It is argued here that
               energy production and consumption are ``massively
               architectured,'' which means that they are strongly influenced
               by factors external to individuals. The infrastructure and
               framework for producing and consuming energy is largely
               determined prior to human decision-making. As a result, it is
               not clear how nudging for sustainable energy consumption could
               be paternalistic or autonomy-reducing. Ethical objections should
               thus not be a deterrent for policy makers pursuing nudges for
               sustainable energy consumption.",

  abstract  = "Default options have an enormous impact on household `` choices.
               '' Such effects are docu-mented in the literature on 401(k)
               plans (see Madrian and Dennis Shea, 2001; Choi et al., 2002,
               2003b). Defaults affect 401(k) participation, savings rates,
               rollovers, and asset allocation. For example, when employees are
               automati-cally enrolled in their 401(k) plan, only a tiny
               fraction opt out, producing nearly 100-percent enrollment. But
               when employees are not auto-matically enrolled, less than half
               enroll on their own during their first year of employment.
               Defaults matter for three key reasons mod-eled in this paper.
               First, acts of commission (e.g., opting out of a default) are
               costly. Second, these costs vary over time, generating an option
               value of waiting for a low-cost period to opt out. Third, people
               are susceptible to procrasti-nation. Even if they want to make a
               change, they have a tendency to delay that change longer than
               they should. These three effects imply that the choice of
               defaults can have sig-nificant welfare consequences. If all
               employees share a common optimal savings rate, selecting an
               optimal default is triv-ial. But the calculation of an optimal
               default is not straightforward if employees have heteroge-neous
               optimal savings rates. In such a world, it may sometimes be
               optimal to set defaults that are far away from the mean optimal
               savings rate. This effect arises for two reasons. First, a
               default that is far from a procrastinating em-ployee's optimal
               savings rate may make the employee better off than a default
               that is closer to the employee's optimal savings rate. A `` bad
               '' default is more likely to motivate opting out than a good but
               imperfect default, potentially overcoming procrastination and
               improving the agent's welfare. Second, our theory implies that
               optimal defaults are highly sensitive to the ac-tual
               distribution of optimal savings rates. In particular, optimal
               defaults are often associated with the modal optimal savings
               rate, which is sometimes extreme (e.g., the plan's minimum or
               maximum contribution rate). At the end of our paper, we
               illustrate these effects with cal-culations of optimal defaults
               for employees at four different companies.",

              promising a monetary reward for attendance. The experiment

              social identity theory to develop the expressive model and
              conduct four studies to compare it to an instrumental explanation
              of campaign involvement. We find strong support for the
              expressive model: a multi-item partisan identity scale better
              accounts for campaign activity than a strong stance on
              subjectively important policy issues, the strength of ideological
              self-placement, or a measure of ideological identity. A series of
              experiments underscore the power of partisan identity to generate
              action-oriented emotions that drive campaign activity. Strongly
              identified partisans feel angrier than weaker partisans when
              threatened with electoral loss and more positive when reassured

              greater anger and enthusiasm among partisans than does a
              threatened loss or victory on central policy issues. Our findings

  abstract = "Contemporary food production and consumption cannot be regarded
              as sustainable and raises problems with its wide scope involving
              diverse actors. Moreover, in the face of demographic change and a
              growing global population, sus-tainability problems arising from
              food systems will likely become more serious in the future. For
              example, agricultural production must deal with the impacts of
              climate change, increasingly challenging land-use conflicts, and
              rising health and social costs on both individual and societal
              levels. The unsustainability of current arrangements arises from
              the industrialization and globalization of agriculture and food
              processing, the shift of consumption patterns toward more dietary
              animal protein, the emergence of modern food styles that entail
              heavily processed products, the growing gap on a global scale
              between rich and poor, and the paradoxical lack of food security
              amid an abundance of food. These factors are attributable to
              national and international policies and regulations, as well as
              to prevalent business prac-tices and, in particular, consumers'
              values and habits. The most effective ways for affluent societies
              to reduce the environmental impact of their diets are to reduce
              consumption of meat and dairy products (especially beef), to
              favor organic fruits and vegetables, and to avoid goods that have
              been transported by air on both individual and institu-tional
              levels (e.g., public procurement, public catering). In examining

              conducting a field experiment among environmental economists
              attending a large international conference on environmental
              economics. The participants were, at the time of registration,
              randomly allocated to different treatments related to carbon
              offsetting. What differs from earlier default studies is that our
              subjects have good knowledge about the good at hand. We
              investigate whether the choices of these experienced individuals
              are affected by a pre-set default option, and we also study the
              effect of a treatment with no pre-set default option. Our
              results, together with previous findings, indicate that the
              effect of a default option attenuates with experience.",

  abstract = "Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) explains liberal-conservative
              differences as arising from different moral intuitions, with
              liberals endorsing `` individualizing '' foundations (Harm and
              Fairness) and conservatives also endorsing `` binding ''
              foundations (Authority, Respect, and Purity). We argue these
              labels misconstrue ideological differences and propose
              Evolutionary-Coalitional Theory (ECT) as an alternative,
              explaining how competitive dynamics in the ancestral social
              environment could produce the observed ideological differences.
              We test ECT against MFT across three studies. Study 1 shows the
              so-called `` binding '' orientation entails the
              threat-sensitivity and outgroup antagonism predicted by ECT; that
              is, an authoritarian motive. Similarly, Study 2 shows the
              so-called `` individualizing '' orientation is better described
              as a universalizing motive, one reflecting a broader set of moral
              commitments (e.g., to nature) and a broader sociality than the
              egocentrism implied by MFT. Study 3 provides a factor analysis
              reducing `` binding '' to authoritarianism and `` individualizing
              '' to universalism, with the latter loading against social
              dominance orientation (SDO). A hierarchical regression then
              provides additional evidence for ECT, showing this dominating
              motive (SDO) accounts for variance in conservatism that MFT
              leaves unexplained. Collectively, these three studies suggest
              that ECT offers a more accurate and precise explanation of the

  abstract = "Much research in the last two decades has demonstrated that human
              responses deviate from the performance deemed normative according
              to various models of decision making and rational judgment (e.g.,
              the basic axioms of utility theory). This gap between the
              normative and the descriptive can be interpreted as indicating
              systematic irrationalities in human cognition. However, four
              alternative interpretations preserve the assumption that human
              behavior and cognition is largely rational. These posit that the
              gap is due to (1) performance errors, (2) computational
              limitations, (3) the wrong norm being applied by the
              experimenter, and (4) a different construal of the task by the
              subject. In the debates about the viability of these alternative
              explanations, attention has been focused too narrowly on the
              model response. In a series of experiments involving most of the
              classic tasks in the heuristics and biases literature, we have
              examined the implications of individual differences in
              performance for each of the four explanations of the
              normative/descriptive gap. Performance errors are a minor factor
              in the gap; computational limitations underlie non-normative
              responding on several tasks, particularly those that involve some
              type of cognitive decontextualization. Unexpected patterns of
              covariance can suggest when the wrong norm is being applied to a

  author   = "Goldacre, Ben",
  abstract = "The attached paper---a study of caning schoolboys---is remarkable
              in many respects. In particular, it illustrates battles that are
              ongoing even half a century later around the ethics, feasibility,
              desirability and political acceptability of randomized trials
              (RCTs) outside medicine. For many working in medical research, it
              can seem pe-culiar that randomized trials are resisted in other
              fields. There are frequently situations in education, policing,
              criminal justice, employment and other areas of policy where RCTs
              could be practical and informative, especially: where there is
              arbitrary variation in the use of a particular intervention;
              where there are broadly reliable and valid outcomes to be
              measured; and where strong claims for ef-fectiveness are being
              made. Trials outside medicine have, however, been slow to come.
              The prospect of an RCT on beating children provides a good---if
              extreme, and rhet-orically dangerous---opportunity to explore the
              broader objections to RCTs outside medicine. First, it is
              important to note that the attached paper was not a randomized
              controlled trial of caning. This was not for want of trying. In
              fact the work by Palmer on caning is mentioned twice, in passing,
              by Archie Cochrane in his 1972 monograph Effectiveness and
              Efficiency, 1 one of the founding documents of evidence-based
              medicine (it is also discussed at some length in Cochrane's
              autobiography). 2 Initially he uses the paper to illustrate the
              weaknesses of data from research into the effectiveness of
              interventions where participants are not randomized:
              Observational evidence is never very satisfactory. An example
              comes from Palmer's work in my own unit…He took very detailed
              smoking histories from all the boys in a secondary modern school
              on two occa-sions, one year apart. He then obtained a list of all
              the boys who had been caned for smoking during that period. He
              was thus able to compare 'change in smok-ing habit' in caned and
              uncaned boys. The results ap-pear at first very striking. Those
              caned increased their cigarette consumption significantly more
              than those who were not caned, but when one thinks about it the
              results do not tell us anything at all. They are equally
              compatible with caning increasing, decreasing, or hav-ing no
              effect on cigarette consumption. Observational evidence is
              clearly better than opinion, but it is thor-oughly
              unsatisfactory.",

  title    = "{The Empirical Case for Two Systems of Reasoning}",

  abstract = "Distinctions have been proposed between systems of reasoning for
              centuries. This article distills properties shared by many of
              these distinctions and characterizes the resulting systems in
              light of recent findings and theoretical developments. One system
              is associative because its computations reflect similarity
              structure and relations of temporal contiguity. The other is
              ``rule based'' because it operates on symbolic structures that
              have logical content and variables and because its computations
              have the properties that are normally assigned to rules. The
              systems serve complementary functions and can simultaneously
              generate different solutions to a reasoning problem. The
              rule-based system can suppress the associative system but not
              completely inhibit it. The article reviews evidence in favor of
              the distinction and its characterization. One of the oldest
              conundrums in psychology is whether peo-ple are best conceived as
              parallel processors of information who operate along diffuse
              associative links or as analysts who operate by deliberate and
              sequential manipulation of internal represen-tations. Are
              inferences drawn through a network of learned as-sociative
              pathways or through application of a kind of ``psycho-logic''
              that manipulates symbolic tokens in a rule-governed way? The
              debate has raged (again) in cognitive psychology for almost a
              decade now. It has pitted those who prefer models of mental
              phenomena to be built out of networks of associative devices that
              pass activation around in parallel and distributed form (the way
              brains probably function) against those who pre-fer models built
              out of formal languages in which symbols are composed into
              sentences that are processed sequentially (the way computers
              function). An obvious solution to the conundrum is to conceive of
              the mind both ways---to argue that the mind has dual aspects, one
              of which conforms to the associationistic view and one of which
              conforms to the analytic, sequential view. Such a dichotomy has
              its appeal: Associative thoughtfeels like it arises from a
              different cognitive mechanism than does deliberate, analytical
              reasoning. Sometimes conclusions simply appear at some level of
              aware-ness, as if the mind goes off, does some work, and then
              comes back with a result, and sometimes coming to a conclusion
              re-quires doing the work oneself, making an effort to construct a
              chain of reasoning. Given an arithmetic problem, such as
              fig-uring out change at the cash register, sometimes the answer
              springs to mind associatively, and sometimes a person has to do
              mental arithmetic by analyzing the amounts involved and operating
              on the resultant components as taught to do in school.",

              may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies
              on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no
              relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific
              field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be
              true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when
              effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and
              lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is
              greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and

              interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a

              Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is
              more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover,
              for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may

              periphery. Consequently, we found that for any tracer, its excess
              of mass, due to only a size excess, a density excess, or both,
              leads to a deep inside segregation of the tracer. There is a
              push-away process that makes heavy beads of any type go
              downwards, while the excess of size is already known to push
              large beads towards the surface, by a dynamical sieving process.
              Each segregation at an intermediate ring corresponds to a balance
              between these mass and geometrical effects. The segregation level
              in the flow is determined by the ratio of the intensities of both
              effects.",

              Theory integration is a longstanding concern in biology,
              economics, or physics, but not in psy-chology. We teach our
              students how to test theories, not the art of theory construction
              in the first place. As a consequence, in some parts of
              psychol-ogy, theories have become replaced by surrogates, such as
              circular restate-ments of the phenomenon, one-word explanations,
              and lists of general dichotomies. Moving backwards from existing
              models to labels is an odd event in science, which typically
              progresses in the opposite direction. Theory construction should
              be taught in graduate school, and editors of major journals
              should encourage submissions that make advances in theory

              research, what surprises every economist or physicist is that
              psychology has no theory. It has many local ones but no
              overarching theory, not even a provisional one. Yet there is
              something even more surprising: a lack of awareness of the value
              of integration. Whereas the unification of theories, such as
              evolutionary theory and genetics, is a widely shared goal in
              physics and biology, it is barely visible in psychology. Few
              psychologists even consider theory integration as an objective. A

              utility theory as a descriptive model of decision making under
              risk, and develops an alternative model, called prospect theory.
              Choices among risky prospects exhibit several pervasive effects
              that are inconsistent with the basic tenets of utility theory. In
              particular, people underweight outcomes that are merely probable
              in comparison with outcomes that are obtained with certainty.
              This tendency, called the certainty effect, contributes to risk
              aversion in choices involving sure gains and to risk seeking in
              choices involving sure losses. In addition, people generally
              discard components that are shared by all prospects under
              consideration. This tendency, called the isolation effect, leads
              to inconsistent preferences when the same choice is presented in
              different forms. An alternative theory of choice is developed, in
              which value is assigned to gains and losses rather than to final
              assets and in which probabilities are replaced by decision
              weights. The value function is normally concave for gains,
              commonly convex for losses, and is generally steeper for losses
              than for gains. Decision weights are generally lower than the
              corresponding probabilities, except in the range of low
              prob-abilities. Overweighting of low probabilities may contribute

  abstract = "At a superficial level, the idea of maximum likelihood must be
              prehistoric: early hunters and gatherers may not have used the
              words ``method of maximum likelihood'' to describe their choice
              of where and how to hunt and gather, but it is hard to believe
              they would have been surprised if their method had been described
              in those terms. It seems a simple, even unassailable idea: Who
              would rise to argue in favor of a method of minimum likelihood,
              or even mediocre likelihood? And yet the mathematical history of
              the topic shows this ``simple idea'' is really anything but
              simple. Joseph Louis Lagrange, Daniel Bernoulli, Leonard Euler,
              Pierre Simon Laplace and Carl Friedrich Gauss are only some of
              those who explored the topic, not always in ways we would
              sanction today. In this article, that history is reviewed from
              back well before Fisher to the time of Lucien Le Cam's
              dissertation. In the process Fisher's unpublished 1930
              characterization of conditions for the consistency and efficiency
              of maximum likelihood estimates is presented, and the
              mathematical basis of his three proofs discussed. In particular,
              Fisher's derivation of the information inequality is seen to be
              derived from his work on the analysis of variance, and his later
              approach via estimating functions was derived from Euler's
              Relation for homogeneous functions. The reaction to Fisher's work
              is reviewed, and some lessons drawn.",

              compliance and conformity research published between 1997 and
              2002. The principles and processes underlying a target's
              susceptibility to out-side influences are considered in light of
              three goals fundamental to rewarding human functioning.
              Specifically, targets are motivated to form accurate perceptions
              of reality and react accordingly, to develop and preserve
              meaningful social relationships, and to maintain a favorable
              self-concept. Consistent with the current movement in compliance
              and conformity research, this review emphasizes the ways in which
              these goals interact with external forces to engender social
              influence processes that are subtle, indirect, and outside of

              review emphasizes research published during the period from
              1996--1998. Across these literatures, three central motives have
              been identified that generate attitude change and resistance.
              These involve concerns with the self, with others and the
              rewards/punishments they can provide, and with a valid
              understanding of reality. The motives have implications for
              information processing and for attitude change in public and
              private contexts. Motives in persuasion also have been
              investigated in research on attitude functions and cognitive
              dissonance theory. In addition, the chapter reviews the
              relatively unique aspects of each literature: In persuasion, it

              occurs. Counts of international events are probably the most
              common, but numerous examples exist in every empirical field of
              the discipline. The results of the analysis below strongly
              suggest that the way event counts have been analyzed in hundreds
              of important political science studies have produced statisti-
              cally and substantively unreliable results. Misspecification,
              inefficiency, bias, inconsistency, insuffi- ciency, and other

              Obesity was defined as body mass index >or= 30 kg/m(2). The data
              were arranged as a panel with multiple observations per

              seems too good to refuse: ``Appoint me and I will let you in on a
              secret policy-setting strategy that has been shown to increase
              savings rates, save lives by improving voluntary efforts, and
              change how people manage risk.'' Even better, the potential
              appointee adds, ``It costs very little and works even if people
              do nothing. In fact, it depends upon people doing nothing.'' What
              is the secret strategy? The proper setting of no-action defaults.
              Default options are those assigned to people who do not make an
              active decision. For example, in the United States, people are by
              default not organ donors and, until recently, did not contribute

              Thaler (1980), a large body of research has incorporated insights
              from psy-chology---such as loss aversion, present bias, and
              inattention---into economic models. 1 Although this subfield of
              behavioral economics has grown very rapidly, the neoclassical
              model remains the benchmark for most economic applications, and
              the validity of behavioral economics as an alter-native paradigm
              continues to be debated. The debate about behavioral economics is
              often framed as a question about the founda-tional assumptions of
              neoclassical economics. Are individuals rational? Do they
              optimize in market settings? This debate has proved to be
              contentious, with compelling arguments in favor 1 Although the
              implications of psychology for economics have been formalized
              using mathematical models only in recent decades, some of these
              ideas were discussed quali-tatively by the founders of classical
              economics themselves, including Adam Smith (Ashraf, Camerer, and

              different settings (e.g., List 2004; Levitt and List 2007;
              DellaVigna 2009). In this paper, I approach the debate on
              behavioral economics from a more pragmatic, policy-oriented
              perspective. Instead of pos-ing the central research question as
              `` Are the assumptions of the neoclassical economic model valid?,
              '' the pragmatic approach starts from a policy question (for
              example, `` How can we increase savings rates? '') and
              incorpo-rates behavioral factors to the extent that they improve
              empirical predictions and policy deci-sions. 2 This approach
              follows the widely applied methodology of positive economics
              advocated by Friedman (1953), who argued that it is more useful
              to evaluate economic models on the accu-racy of their empirical
              predictions than on their assumptions. 3 While Friedman used this
              reason-ing to argue in favor of neoclassical models, I argue that
              modern evidence calls for incorpo-rating behavioral economics
              into the analysis of important economic questions. I classify the
              implications of behavioral eco-nomics for public policy into
              three domains. Each of these domains has a long intellectual
              tradition in economics, showing that from a pragmatic
              perspective, behavioral economics represents a natural
              progression of (rather than a challenge to) neoclassical economic
              methods. First, behavioral economics offers new pol-icy tools
              that can be used to influence behavior.",

               decisions on topics ranging from personal investments to schools
               for our children to the meals we eat to the causes we champion.
               Unfortunately, we often choose poorly. Nobel laureate Richard
               Thaler and legal scholar and bestselling author Cass Sunstein
               explain in this important exploration of choice architecture
               that, being human, we all are susceptible to various biases that
               can lead us to blunder. Our mistakes make us poorer and less
               healthy; we often make bad decisions involving education,
               personal finance, health care, mortgages and credit cards, the
               family, and even the planet itself. In Nudge, Thaler and
               Sunstein invite us to enter an alternative world, one that takes
               our humanness as a given. They show that by knowing how people

               people to choose what is best for themselves, their families,
               and their society. Using colorful examples from the most
               important aspects of life, Thaler and Sunstein demonstrate how

              behavior that they could be considered ``hidden persuaders'' in
              sonríe settings, ignoring defaults is not a sound option for
              marketers or consumer policy makers. The authors identify three
              theoretical causes of default effects---impiied endorsement,
              cognitive biases, and effort---to guide thought on the
              appropriate marketer and policy maker responses to the issues
              posed for consumer welfare and consumer autonomy, including
              proposals for benign ``nudges'' of behavior. Defaults can be a
              preferred form of decision architecture; that is, other

  abstract  = "CONTEXT: Millions of uninsured Americans ostensibly have
               insurance available to them-many at very low cost-but do not
               take it up. Traditional economic analysis is based on the
               premise that these are rational decisions, but it is hard to
               reconcile observed enrollment patterns with this view. The
               policy prescriptions that the traditional model generates may
               thus fail to achieve their goals. Behavioral economics, which
               integrates insights from psychology into economic analysis,
               identifies important deviations from the traditional assumptions
               of rationality and can thus improve our understanding of what
               drives health insurance take-up and improved policy design.
               METHODS: Rather than a systematic review of the coverage
               literature, this article is a primer for considering issues in
               health insurance coverage from a behavioral economics
               perspective, supplementing the standard model. We present
               relevant evidence on decision making and insurance take-up and
               use it to develop a behavioral approach to both the policy
               problem posed by the lack of health insurance coverage and
               possible policy solutions to that problem. FINDINGS: We found
               that evidence from behavioral economics can shed light on both
               the sources of low take-up and the efficacy of different policy
               levers intended to expand coverage. We then applied these
               insights to policy design questions for public and private
               insurance coverage and to the implementation of the recently
               enacted health reform, focusing on the use of behavioral
               insights to maximize the value of spending on coverage.
               CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that the success of health insurance
               coverage reform depends crucially on understanding the
               behavioral barriers to take-up. The take-up process is likely
               governed by psychology as much as economics, and public
               resources can likely be used much more effectively with
               behaviorally informed policy design.",

  abstract = "(from the jacket) Much popular belief--and public policy--rests
              on the idea that those born into poverty have it in their power
              to escape. But the persistence of poverty and ever-growing
              economic inequality around the world has led many economists to
              seriously question the model of individual economic
              self-determination when it comes to the poor. In Poverty Traps,
              Samuel Bowles, Steven Durlauf, Karla Hoff, and the book's other
              contributors argue that there are many conditions that may trap
              individuals, groups, and whole economies in intractable poverty.
              For the first time the editors have brought together the
              perspectives of economics, economic history, and sociology to
              assess what we know--and don't know--about such traps. Among the
              sources of the poverty of nations, the authors assign a primary
              role to social and political institutions, ranging from
              corruption to seemingly benign social customs such as kin
              systems. Many of the institutions that keep nations poor have
              deep roots in colonial history and persist long after their
              initial causes are gone. Neighborhood effects--influences such as
              networks, role models, and aspirations--can create hard-to-escape
              pockets of poverty even in rich countries. Similar individuals in
              dissimilar socioeconomic environments develop different
              preferences and beliefs that can transmit poverty or affluence
              from generation to generation. The book presents evidence of
              harmful neighborhood effects and discusses policies to overcome
              them, with attention to the uncertainty that exists in evaluating
              such policies. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights

              have been identified as potential mechanisms that tax authorities
              can use to reduce noncompliance. They achieve this by simplifying
              the process of filing taxes, thus reducing the scope for errors.
              However, defaults may increase the scope for evasion if set
              incorrectly. The authors report experimental data on the effect
              of correct and incorrect defaults. They find that prepopulating
              tax returns is a worthwhile policy only if it is done with highly
              reliable information. Setting default levels that underestimate
              taxpayers' true tax liability leads to significant drops in
              compliance and tax revenue. The authors also study whether nudges
              that contain messages with descriptive norms about compliance can
              mitigate the adverse effect of prepopulated returns with

               stress randomization-based inference as opposed to
               sampling-based inference. In randomization-based inference,
               uncertainty in estimates arises naturally from the random
               assignment of the treatments, rather than from hypothesized
               sampling from a large population. We show how this perspective
               relates to regression analyses for randomized experiments. We
               discuss the analyses of stratified, paired, and clustered
               randomized experiments, and we stress the general efficiency
               gains from stratification. We also discuss complications in
               randomized experiments such as non-compliance. In the presence
               of non-compliance we contrast intention-to-treat analyses with
               instrumental variables analyses allowing for general treatment

              the idea that those born into poverty have it in their power to
              escape. But the persistence of poverty and ever-growing economic
              inequality around the world has led many economists to seriously
              question the model of individual economic self-determination when
              it comes to the poor. In Poverty Traps, Samuel Bowles, Steven
              Durlauf, Karla Hoff, and the book's other contributors argue that
              there are many conditions that may trap individuals, groups, and
              whole economies in intractable poverty. For the first time the
              editors have brought together the perspectives of economics,
              economic history, and sociology to assess what we know-and don't
              know-about such traps. Among the sources of the poverty of
              nations, the authors assign a primary role to social and
              political institutions, ranging from corruption to seemingly
              benign social customs such as kin systems. Many of the
              institutions that keep nations poor have deep roots in colonial
              history and persist long after their initial causes are gone.
              Neighborhood effects-influences such as networks, role models,
              and aspirations-can create hard-to-escape pockets of poverty even
              in rich countries. Similar individuals in dissimilar
              socioeconomic environments develop different preferences and
              beliefs that can transmit poverty or affluence from generation to
              generation. The book presents evidence of harmful neighborhood
              effects and discusses policies to overcome them, with attention
              to the uncertainty that exists in evaluating such policies.

               approaches to public policy and health promotion A tradition of
               experimental sociology was well established by the 1930s, built
               on the early use of controlled experiments in psychology and
               education From the early 1960s to early 1980s randomised
               experiments were considered the optimal design for evaluating
               public policy interventions in the United States, and major
               evaluations using this design were carried out This approach
               became less popular as policy makers reacted negatively to
               evidence of ``near zero'' effects Lessons to be learnt about
               implementing randomised controlled trials in real life settings

  abstract = "Most randomized controlled trials (RCT) of social programs test
              interventions at modest scale. While the hope is that promising
              programs will be scaled up, we have few successful examples of
              this scale-up process in practice. Ideally we would like to know
              which programs will work at large scale before we invest the
              resources to take them to scale. But it would seem that the only
              way to tell whether a program works at scale is to test it at
              scale. Our goal in this paper is to propose a way out of this
              Catch-22. We first develop a simple model that helps clarify the
              type of scale-up challenge for which our method is most relevant.
              Most social programs rely on labor as a key input (teachers,
              nurses, social workers, etc.). We know people vary greatly in
              their skill at these jobs. So social programs, like firms,
              confront a search problem in the labor market that can lead to
              inelastically-supplied human capital. The result is that as
              programs scale, either average costs must increase if program
              quality is to be held constant, or else program quality will
              decline if average costs are held fixed. Our proposed method for
              reducing the costs of estimating program impacts at large scale
              combines the fact that hiring inherently involves ranking inputs
              with the most powerful element of the social science toolkit:
              randomization. We show that it is possible to operate a program
              at modest scale n but learn about the input supply curves facing
              the firm at much larger scale (S $\times$ n) by randomly sampling
              the inputs the provider would have hired if they operated at
              scale (S $\times$ n). We build a simple two-period model of
              social-program decision making and use a model of Bayesian
              learning to develop heuristics for when scale-up experiments of
              the sort we propose are likely to be particularly valuable. We
              also present a series of results to illustrate the method,
              including one application to a real-world tutoring program that
              highlights an interesting observation: The noisier the program
              provider's prediction of input quality, the less pronounced is
              the scale-up problem.",

               communities worldwide. An influential study conducted in Kenya
               in 1998-99 reported that a school-based drug-and-educational
               intervention had benefits regarding worm infections and school
               attendance. Effects were seen among children treated with
               deworming drugs, untreated children in intervention schools and
               children in nearby non-intervention schools. Combining these
               effects, the intervention was reported to increase school
               attendance by 7.5\% in treated children. Effects on other
               outcomes (worm infections, anaemia, nutritional status and
               examination performance) were also investigated. METHODS In this
               pure replication, we used data provided by the original authors
               to re-analyse the study according to their methods. We compared
               these results against those presented in the original paper.
               RESULTS Although most results were reproduced as originally
               reported, we identified discrepancies of several types between
               the original findings and re-analysis. For worm infections,
               re-analysis showed reductions similar to those originally
               reported. For anaemia prevalence, in contrast to the original
               findings, re-analysis found no evidence of benefit. For
               nutritional status, both original findings and re-analysis
               described modest evidence for a small improvement. For school
               attendance, re-analysis showed benefits similar to those
               originally found in intervention schools for both children who
               did and those who did not receive deworming drugs. However,
               after correction of coding errors, there was little evidence of
               an indirect effect on school attendance among children in
               schools close to intervention schools. Combining these effects
               gave a total increase in attendance of 3.9\% among treated
               children, which was no longer statistically significant. As in
               the original results, re-analysis found no effect of the
               intervention on examination performance. CONCLUSIONS Re-applying
               analytical approaches originally used, but correcting various
               errors, we found little evidence for some previously-reported
               indirect effects of a deworming intervention. Effects on worm
               infections, nutritional status, examination performance and
               school attendance on children in intervention schools were
               largely unchanged.",

              distributed on economic and psychological outcomes three years

              trial, we find that transfer recipients have higher levels of
              asset holdings, consumption, food security and psychological
              well-being relative to non-recipients in the same village. The
              effects are similar in magnitude to those observed in a previous
              study nine months after the beginning of the program. Comparing
              recipient households to non-recipients in distant villages, we
              find that transfer recipients have 40\% more assets (USD 422 PPP)
              than control households three years after the transfer,
              equivalent to 60\% of the initial transfer (USD 709 PPP). In
              contrast, other outcomes do not show significant treatment
              effects in the across-village analysis, possibly owing to lower
              power and within-village spillovers. We do find some spillover
              effects. Households impacted by spillovers have lower consumption
              and food security than pure control households, perhaps due to
              the sale of productive assets. Estimates of spillover effects on
              other outcomes are inconclusive due to differential attrition
              between spillover and pure control households. We also find
              little evidence of differential treatment effects depending on
              the transfer design (whether transfers are made men or women, in
              monthly payments or a single lump-sum, or a large or small
              transfer). Thus, cash transfers result in sustained increases in
              assets. Long-term impacts on other dimensions, and potential
              spillover effects, remain to be substantiated by future work.

              aid and about what kind of projects can engender economic
              development. There is skepticism about the ability of econometric
              analysis to resolve these issues or of development agencies to
              learn from their own experience. In response, there is increasing
              use in development economics of randomized controlled trials
              (RCTs) to accumulate credible knowledge of what works, without
              overreliance on questionable theory or statistical methods. When
              RCTs are not possible, the proponents of these methods advocate
              quasi-\textbackslashnrandomization through instrumental variable
              (IV) techniques or natural experiments. I argue that many of
              these applications are unlikely to recover quantities that are
              useful for policy or understanding: two key issues are the
              misunderstanding of exogeneity and the handling of heterogeneity.
              I illustrate from the literature on aid and growth. Actual
              randomization faces similar problems as does quasi-randomization,
              notwithstanding rhetoric to the contrary. I argue that
              experiments have no special ability to produce more credible
              knowledge than other methods, and that actual experiments are
              frequently subject to practical problems that undermine any
              claims to statistical or epistemic superiority. I illustrate
              using prominent experiments in development and elsewhere. As with
              IV methods, RCT-based evaluation of projects, without guidance

               to function efficiently. Recognizing this, public policies often
               pair competition with easy access to comparative information.
               The implicit assumption is that comparison friction---the wedge
               between the availability of comparative information and
               consumers' use of it---is inconsequential because information is
               readily available and consumers will access this information and
               make effective choices. We examine the extent of comparison
               friction in the market for Medicare Part D prescription drug
               plans in the United States. In a randomized field experiment, an
               intervention group received a letter with personalized cost
               information. That information was readily available for free and
               widely advertised. However, this additional step---providing the
               information rather than having consumers actively access
               it---had an impact. Plan switching was 28 percent in the
               intervention group, versus 17 percent in the comparison group,
               and the intervention caused an average decline in predicted
               consumer cost of about \$100 per year among letter
               recipients---roughly 5 percent of the cost in the comparison
               group. Our results suggest that comparison friction can be large
               even when the cost of acquiring information is small, and may be

              illustrates how the idea of evaluation as a source of 'truth' was

              And what are the consequences of that process? Like individuals,
              Congress is subject to the ``paradox of search.'' If policy
              makers don't look for problems, they won't find those that need
              to be addressed. But if they carry out a thorough search, they
              will almost certainly find new problems---and with the definition
              of each new problem comes the possibility of creating a
              government program to address it. With The Politics of Attention,
              leading policy scholars Frank R. Baumgartner and Bryan D. Jones
              demonstrated the central role attention plays in how governments
              prioritize problems. Now, with The Politics of Information, they
              turn the focus to the problem-detection process itself, showing
              how the growth or contraction of government is closely related to
              how it searches for information and how, as an organization, it
              analyzes its findings. Better search processes that incorporate
              more diverse viewpoints lead to more intensive policymaking
              activity. Similarly, limiting search processes leads to declines
              in policy making. At the same time, the authors find little
              evidence that the factors usually thought to be responsible for
              government expansion---partisan control, changes in presidential
              leadership, and shifts in public opinion---can be systematically
              related to the patterns they observe. Drawing on data tracing the
              course of American public policy since World War II, Baumgartner

              American policy making.",

              interest, producing solutions in anticipation of attention to

              each 'window'. In large systems, they are like surfers waiting

              psychology have undergone such dramatic conceptual changes in the
              past decade as the emerging science of heuristics. Heuristics are
              efficient cognitive processes, conscious or unconscious, that
              ignore part of the information. Because using heuristics saves
              effort, the classical view has been that heuristic decisions
              imply greater errors than do ``rational'' decisions as defined by
              logic or statistical models. However, for many decisions, the
              assumptions of rational models are not met, and it is an
              empirical rather than an a priori issue how well cognitive
              heuristics function in an uncertain world. To answer both the
              descriptive question (``Which heuristics do people use in which
              situations?'') and the prescriptive question (``When should
              people rely on a given heuristic rather than a complex strategy
              to make better judgments?''), formal models are indispensable. We
              review research that tests formal models of heuristic inference,
              including in business organizations, health care, and legal
              institutions. This research indicates that (a) individuals and
              organizations often rely on simple heuristics in an adaptive way,
              and (b) ignoring part of the information can lead to more
              accurate judgments than weighting and adding all information, for
              instance for low predictability and small samples. The big future
              challenge is to develop a systematic theory of the building
              blocks of heuristics as well as the core capacities and
              environmental structures these exploit.",

               the value of the status quo and the assignment of the better or

               worse outcome were always considered worse than omissions
               leading to the worse outcome. This act-omission difference was

              on nine issues, we find politicians of both parties dramatically
              overestimate their constituents' support for conservative
              policies. This pattern is robust across methods, years, issues,

              constituency conservatism especially and that this partisan
              difference may arise from differences in politicians' information
              environments. Our findings suggest a novel way democratic

              the remaining 17 also included patients and/or other healthcare
              providers. Data collection was based mainly on interviews,
              followed by questionnaires and focus groups, and the
              methodologies mainly used for data analysis were grounded theory
              and thematic analysis. Factors cited by physicians as having an
              impact on antibiotic prescribing were grouped into those that
              were intrinsic (group 1) and those that were extrinsic (group 2)
              to the healthcare professional. Among the former, physicians'
              attitudes, such as complacency or fear, were rated as being most

              factors (e.g. signs and symptoms) or healthcare system-related
              factors (e.g. time pressure and policies/guidelines implemented)

              report to David Sackett, of how evidence-based medicine (EBM) was
              hijacked to serve vested interests: major randomized controlled
              trials are largely done by and for the benefit of the industry;
              meta-analyses and guidelines are flooded with conflicts of
              interest; national and federal research funds are unable to
              address basic clinical questions. Nonetheless, EBM would remain a
              worthwhile goal. In this paper, in the form of a report to Alvan
              Feinstein, it is argued that current developments were largely
              predictable. EBM certainly gave an important contribution to
              questioning unsubstantiated therapeutic claims. Time has come,
              however, to become aware of its considerable limitations,
              including overall reductionism and insufficient consideration of
              problems related to financial conflicts of interest. EBM does not
              represent the scientific approach to medicine: it is only a
              restrictive interpretation of the scientific approach to clinical
              practice. EBM drives the prescribing clinician to an
              overestimated consideration of potential benefits, paying little

              vulnerabilities in relations to the adverse effects of treatment.

               of systematic research (or `evi- dence') into policy
               development, programevaluation and programimprovement. This
               process is consistent with the New Public Management (NPM)
               emphasis on efficiency and effective- ness. Analysis of evidence
               helps to answer the questions `what works? and `what happens if
               we change these settings?' Secondly, some of the well known
               challenges and limitations for `evidence-based' policy are
               outlined. Policy decisions emerge from politics, judgement and
               debate, rather than being deduced from empirical analysis.
               Policy debate and analysis involves an interplay between facts,
               norms and desired actions, in which `evidence' is diverse and
               contestable. Thirdly, the article outlines a distinction between
               technical and negotiated approaches to problem-solving. The
               latter is a prominent feature of policy domains rich in
               `network' approaches, partnering and community engagement.
               Networks and partnerships bring to the negotiation table a
               diversity of stakeholder `evidence', ie, relevant information,
               interpretations and priorities. Finally, it is suggested that
               three types of evidence/perspective are especially relevant in
               the modern era -- systematic (`scientific') research, program
               man- agement experience (`practice'), and political judgement.
               What works for program clients is intrinsically connected to
               what works for managers and for political leaders. Thus, the
               prac- tical craft of policy development and adjustment involves
               `weaving' strands of information and values as seen through the
               lens of these three key stakeholder groups. There is not one
               evidence-base but several bases. These disparate bodies of
               knowledge become multiple sets of evidence that inform and
               influence policy rather than determine it. Key",

               policy making evidence has always been interpreted broadly to
               cover all types of reasoned enquiry and after some debate the
               same is now true for health promotion. Taking communities rather

  abstract = "Since Edward Leamer's memorable 1983 paper, ``Let's Take the Con
              out of Econometrics,'' empirical microeconomics has experienced a
              credibility revolution. While Leamer's suggested remedy,
              sensitivity analysis, has played a role in this, we argue that
              the primary engine driving improvement has been a focus on the
              quality of empirical research designs. The advantages of a good
              research design are perhaps most easily apparent in research
              using random assignment. We begin with an overview of Leamer's
              1983 critique and his proposed remedies. We then turn to the key
              factors we see contributing to improved empirical work, including
              the availability of more and better data, along with advances in
              theoretical econometric understanding, but especially the fact
              that research design has moved front and center in much of
              empirical micro. We offer a brief digression into macroeconomics
              and industrial organization, where progress -- by our lights --
              is less dramatic, although there is work in both fields that we
              find encouraging. Finally, we discuss the view that the design
              pendulum has swung too far. Critics of design-driven studies
              argue that in pursuit of clean and credible research designs,
              researchers seek good answers instead of good questions. We
              briefly respond to this concern, which worries us little.",

               narrow logical norms, that is, a misunderstanding of the nature

               selective reporting of research. These two flaws focus the blame

               industries that spend billions to nudge people into unhealthy

               suggest that the neuroscience of decision making can provide a
               framework for understanding how nudges work, and how they can be
               improved. Towards this end, we first examine how nudges can be
               incorporated into a leading model of decision making supported
               by neuro- biological data, and use the model to make predictions
               about the relative effectiveness of different classes of nudges.
               We then use the model to demonstrate how nudges can both
               infringe upon and promote autonomy. Finally, we explore the
               normative implications of the converging consensus from

               which calls for careful clinical judgment in evaluating the
               ``best available evidence,'' should be differentiated from the
               special collection of data regarded as suitable evidence.
               Although the proposed practice does not seem new, the new
               collection of ``best available'' information has major
               constraints for the care of individual patients.Derived almost
               exclusively from randomized trials and meta-analyses, the data
               do not include many types of treatments or patients seen in
               clinical practice; and the results show comparative efficacy of
               treatment for an ``average'' randomized patient, not for
               pertinent subgroups formed by such cogent clinical features as
               severity of symptoms, illness, co-morbidity, and other clinical
               nuances. The intention-to-treat analyses do not reflect
               important post-randomization events leading to altered
               treatment; and the results seldom provide suitable background
               data when therapy is given prophylactically rather than
               remedially, or when therapeutic advantages are equivocal.
               Randomized trial information is also seldom available for issues
               in etiology, diagnosis, and prognosis, and for clinical
               decisions that depend on pathophysiologic changes, psychosocial
               factors and support, personal preferences of patients, and
               strategies for giving comfort and reassurance.The laudable goal
               of making clinical decisions based on evidence can be impaired
               by the restricted quality and scope of what is collected as
               ``best available evidence.'' The authoritative aura given to the
               collection, however, may lead to major abuses that produce
               inappropriate guidelines or doctrinaire dogmas for clinical

              came close to creating such a Fairy Godmother when it required

               subversively manipulates individuals, thus contravening their
               personal autonomy. In this article I address two arguments to
               this effect. First, I deny that choice architecture is
               necessarily heteronomous. I explain the reasons we have for
               avoiding heteronomous policy-making and offer a set of four
               conditions for non- heteronomy. I then provide examples of
               nudges that meet these conditions. I argue that these policies
               are capable of respecting and promoting personal autonomy, and
               show this claim to be true across contrasting conceptions of
               autonomy. Second, I deny that choice architecture is
               disrespectful because it is epistemically paternalistic. This
               critique appears to loom large even against non-heteronomous
               nudges. However, I argue that while some of these policies may
               exhibit epistemically paternalistic tendencies, these tendencies
               do not necessarily undermine personal autonomy. Thus, ifwe are

               for the design of population-wide health interventions. The
               concept of nudge puts a label on efficacious influences that
               preserve freedom of choice without engaging the influencees'
               deliberative capacities. Given disagreements over what it takes
               genuinely to preserve freedom of choice, the question is whether
               health influences relying on automatic cognitive processes may
               preserve freedom of choice in a sufficiently robust sense to be
               serviceable for the moral evaluation of actions and policies. In
               this article, I offer an argument to this effect, explicating
               preservation of freedom of choice in terms of choice-set
               preservation and noncontrol. I also briefly explore the
               healthcare contexts in which nudges may have priority over more

               be in their own interest (e.g., risking severe head injuries by
               riding a motorcycle without a helmet), it is not uncommon for
               governments to attempt to change that behavior. Governmental
               policy makers can apply established tools from the governmental
               toolbox to this end (e.g., laws, regulations, incentives, and
               disincentives). Alternatively, they can employ new tools that
               capitalize on the wealth of knowledge about human behavior and
               behavior change that has been accumulated in the behavioral
               sciences (e.g., psychology and economics). Two contrasting
               approaches to behavior change are nudge policies and boost
               policies. These policies rest on fundamentally different
               research programs on bounded rationality, namely, the heuristics
               and biases program and the simple heuristics program,
               respectively. This article examines the policy--theory coherence
               of each approach. To this end, it identifies the necessary
               assumptions underlying each policy and analyzes to what extent
               these assumptions are implied by the theoretical commitments of
               the respective research program. Two key results of this
               analysis are that the two policy approaches rest on diverging
               assumptions and that both suffer from disconnects with the
               respective theoretical program, but to different degrees:
               Nudging appears to be more adversely affected than boosting
               does. The article concludes with a discussion of the limits of
               the chosen evaluative dimension, policy--theory coherence, and
               reviews some other benchmarks on which policy programs can be

               distinct periods of field experimentation that have influenced
               the economics literature. The first might well be thought of as
               the dawn of ``field'' experimentation: the work of Neyman and
               Fisher, who laid the experimental foundation in the 1920s and
               1930s by conceptualizing randomization as an instrument to
               achieve identification via experimentation with agricultural
               plots. The second, the large-scale social experiments conducted
               by government agencies in the mid-twentieth century, moved the
               exploration from plots of land to groups of individuals. More
               recently, the nature and range of field experiments has
               expanded, with a diverse set of controlled experiments being
               completed outside of the typical laboratory environment. With
               this growth, the number and types of questions that can be
               explored using field experiments has grown tremendously. After
               discussing these three distinct phases, we speculate on the
               future of field experimental methods, a future that we envision

  abstract  = "I agree with Deaton and Cartwright that randomized trials are
               often overrated. There is a strange form of reasoning we often
               see in science, which is the idea that a chain of reasoning is
               as strong as its strongest link. The social science and medical
               research literature is full of papers in which a randomized
               experiment is performed, a statistically significant comparison
               is found, and then story time begins, and continues, and
               continues---as if the rigor from the randomized experiment
               somehow suffuses through the entire analysis. Here are some
               reasons why the results of a randomized trial cannot be taken as
               representing a general discovery: 1. Measurement. A causal
               effect on a surrogate endpoint does not necessarily map to an
               effect on the outcome of interest. Direct measurements also can
               be problematic if there is bias that is correlated with
               treatment assignment, as can occur in medical experiments
               without blinding or psychology experiments in which there is
               information leakage. 2. Missing data. Even a small proportion of
               dropout or nonresponse can bias the estimate of treatment
               effects, if missingness is correlated with outcome and treatment
               assignment. 3. Extrapolation. The participants in a controlled
               trial are typically not representative of the larger population
               of interest. This causes no problem if the treatment effect is
               constant but can leads to bias to the extent that treatment
               effects are nonlinear and have interactions. A related concern
               is realism: extrapolating from often-artificial experimental
               conditions to the real-world settings where the treatment might
               be applied. 4. Researcher degrees of freedom. The many options
               arising in data coding and analysis make it easy for researchers
               to obtain `` statistically significant '' p-values even in the
               absence of any large and consistent underlying effects. The fact

              as-if random variation in treatment assignment, adjustment for
              baseline covariates is unnecessary. In many applications,
              however, some adjustment for baseline covariates may be
              necessary. As such, analysts may wish to combine identification
              strategies---using both spatial proximity and covariates. We
              propose a matching framework to incorporate information about
              both geographic proximity and observed covariates flexibly which
              allows us to minimize spatial distance while preserving balance
              on observed covariates. This framework is also applicable to
              regression discontinuity designs that are not based on geography.

               might appear to be self-evident. But a closer analysis reveals a
               number of problems and paradoxes inherent in the concept of
               ``evidence-based policymaking.'' The current conflict over
               evidence-based policymaking parallels a long-standing ``paradigm
               war'' in social research between positivist, interpretivist, and
               critical approaches. This article draws from this debate in
               order to inform the discussions over the appropriateness of
               evidence- based policymaking and the related question of what is
               the nature of policymaking. The positivist, empiricist worldview
               that underpins the theory and practice of evidence-based
               medicine (EBM) fails to address key elements of the policymaking

               policymaking is inherently unable to explore the complex,
               context-dependent, and value-laden way in which competing
               options are negotiated by individuals and interest groups.
               Sociolinguistic tools such as argumentation theory offer
               opportunities for developing richer theories about how
               policymaking happens. Such tools also have potential practical
               application in the policymaking process: by enhancing
               participants' awareness of their own values and those of others,

               select models that yield positive findings, leading to an
               unreliable body of published research. To combat this
               ``fishing'' problem in medical studies, leading journals now
               require pre-registration of designs that emphasize the prior
               identification of dependent and independent variables. However,
               we demonstrate here that even with this level of advanced

               is latitude over selection of covariates, subgroups, and other
               elements of an analysis plan. These concerns could be addressed
               through the use of a form of comprehensive registration. We
               experiment with such an approach in the context of an ongoing

              using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data. We
              selected 13 variables as adjustment covariates and computed 8,192
              Cox models for each of 417 variables' associations with all-cause
              mortality. RESULTS We present the VoE by assessing the variance
              of the effect size and in the -log10(P-value) obtained by
              different combinations of adjustments. We present whether there
              are multimodality patterns in effect sizes and P-values and the
              trajectory of results with increasing adjustments. For 31\% of

              being in opposite direction in the 99th versus the 1st percentile

               we challenge the de facto orthodoxy that has connected the
               deficit model and contextualist perspectives with quantitative
               and qualitative research methods respectively. We simultaneously
               test hypotheses from both theoretical approaches using
               quantitative methodology. The results point to the clear
               importance of knowledge as a determinant of attitudes toward
               science. However, in contrast to the rather simplistic deficit
               model that has traditionally characterized discussions of this
               relationship, this analysis highlights the complex and
               interacting nature of the knowledge--- attitude interface.",

               participation is significantly higher under automatic
               enrollment. Second, a substantial fraction of 401(k)
               participants hired under automatic enrollment retain both the
               default contribu- tion rate and fund allocation even though few

               particular outcome. This ``default'' behavior appears to result
               from participant inertia and from employee perceptions of the
               default as investment advice. These findings have implications

              treatment assignment can be analyzed in a standard regression
              discontinuity (RD) framework if the exact geo-graphic location of
              each unit in the dataset is known. Such data, how-ever, is often
              unavailable due to privacy considerations or measurement
              limitations. In the absence of geo-referenced individual-level

              geographic information is available. If researchers have
              information about each observation's loca-tion within aggregate

              applied, where the running variable is treated as discrete

              officers who wore Body Worn Cameras (BWCs) in Rialto, California
              found that among those officers who wore the devices, use of
              force incidents decreased, as did complaints against the

              practice, such systems need to automatically choose a good

              hand, and also set their respective hyperparameters. Recent work
              has started to tackle this automated machine learning (AutoML)
              problem with the help of efficient Bayesian optimization methods.
              In this work we introduce a robust new AutoML system based on
              scikit-learn (using 15 classifiers, 14 feature preprocessing
              methods, and 4 data preprocessing methods, giving rise to a
              structured hypothesis space with 110 hyperparameters). This
              system, which we dub auto-sklearn, improves on existing AutoML
              methods by automatically taking into account past performance on
              similar datasets, and by constructing ensembles from the models
              evaluated during the optimization. Our system won the first phase
              of the ongoing ChaLearn AutoML challenge, and our comprehensive
              analysis on over 100 diverse datasets shows that it substantially
              outperforms the previous state of the art in AutoML.We also
              demonstrate the performance gains due to each of our
              contributions and derive insights into the effectiveness of the

               Among the major perceptual findings are that command staff
               believe BWCs will impact police officers' decisions to use force
               in encounters with citizens and police will be more reluctant to
               use necessary force in encounters with the public. Respondents

               too. This paper attempts to critically summarize current
               developments in the young field of political methodology. It
               focuses on recent generalizations of
               dichotomous-dependent-variable estimators such as logit and
               probit, arguing that even our best new work needs a firmer
               connection to credible models of human behavior and deeper

               a carcinogen, that pregnant women should drink not a drop of
               alcohol. Major medical journals first claimed that hormone
               replacement therapy reduces the risk of heart disease, then
               reversed themselves and said it increases the risk of heart
               disease. What are the effects caused by consuming alcohol or by
               receiving hormone replacement therapy? These are causal
               questions, questions about the effects caused by treatments,
               policies or preventable exposures. Some causal questions can be
               studied in randomized trials, in which a coin is flipped to
               decide the treatment for the next experimental subject. Because
               randomized trials are not always practical, nor always ethical,
               many causal questions are investigated in non-randomized
               observational studies. The reversal of opinion about hormone
               replacement therapy occurred when a randomized clinical trial
               contradicted a series of earlier observational studies. Using
               minimal mathematics - high school algebra and coin flips -- and

              level of native governing authority? Although this is a central
              question within the literature on foreign occupation and
              insurgency, it is difficult to answer because the relationship
              between resistance and political devolution is typically
              endogenous. To address this issue, we identify a natural
              experiment based on the locally arbitrary assignment of French
              municipalities into German or Vichy-governed zones during World
              War II. Using a regression discontinuity design, we conclude that
              devolving governing authority significantly lowered levels of
              resistance. We argue that this effect is driven by a process of
              political cooptation: domestic groups that were granted governing
              authority were less likely to engage in resistance activity,
              while violent resistance was heightened in regions dominated by
              groups excluded from the governing regime. This finding stands in
              contrast to work that primarily emphasizes structural factors or

               randomised trials have looked at the effectiveness of BWVs,
               primarily focusing on use of force and complaints. We sought to
               replicate these studies, adding assaults against police officers
               as an additional outcome. Using a prospective meta-analysis of
               multi-site, multi-national randomised controlled trials from 10
               discrete tests with a total population of +2 million, and 2.2
               million police officer-hours, we assess the effect of BWVs on
               the rates of (i) police use of force and (ii) assaults against
               officers. Averaged over 10 trials, BWVs had no effect on police
               use of force (d = 0.021; SE = 0.056; 95\% CI: --0.089--0.130),

               As there is evidence that cameras may increase the risk of
               assaults against officers, more attention should be paid to how
               these devices are implemented. Likewise, since other

              these problematic norms, there is growing interest in

              bulk of this work is centered around randomized controlled

              contents for observational pre-analysis plans, and highlight

               for every parliamentary election in the life of Imperial Germany
               (1871--1912) after its adoption of universal male suffrage in
               1871. The article analyzes the election of over 5,000
               parliamentary seats to identify where and why elections were
               disputed as a result of ``election misconduct.'' The empirical
               analysis demonstrates that electoral fraud's incidence is
               significantly related to a society's level of inequality in
               landholding, a major source of wealth, power, and prestige in
               this period. After weighing the importance of two different
               causal mechanisms, the article concludes that socioeconomic
               inequality, by making elections endogenous to preexisting social
               power, can be a major and underappreciated barrier to the
               long-term process of democratization even after the ``choice''
               of formally democratic rules.",

               especially for students in the social sciences and allied
               fieldsQuantitative analysis is an increasingly essential skill
               for social science research, yet students in the social sciences
               and related areas typically receive little training in it---or
               if they do, they usually end up in statistics classes that offer
               few insights into their field. This textbook is a practical
               introduction to data analysis and statistics written especially
               for undergraduates and beginning graduate students in the social
               sciences and allied fields, such as economics, sociology, public
               policy, and data science.Quantitative Social Science engages
               directly with empirical analysis, showing students how to
               analyze data using the R programming language and to interpret
               the results---it encourages hands-on learning, not
               paper-and-pencil statistics. More than forty data sets taken
               directly from leading quantitative social science research
               illustrate how data analysis can be used to answer important
               questions about society and human behavior.Proven in the
               classroom, this one-of-a-kind textbook features numerous
               additional data analysis exercises and interactive R programming
               exercises, and also comes with supplementary teaching materials

  author    = "Tyler, Tom R",
  abstract  = "People within organized groups often internalize their feelings
               of obligation to obey group rules and the decisions of group
               authorities. They believe that group authorities and rules are
               legitimate and, hence, entitled to be obeyed. Because of this
               belief, group members voluntarily accept and obey rules and
               decisions from group authorities. This review draws on evidence
               from studies of authorities in political, legal, managerial,
               educational, and family settings to explore why people view as
               legitimate and voluntarily defer to group authorities. Two
               theories about legitimacy are contrasted: resource-based
               theories, represented by instrumental models, and identification
               based theories, represented by the relational model. The
               findings provide strong support for the existence of a
               relational component of legitimacy, suggesting that authorities
               draw an important part of their legitimacy from their social
               relationship with group members. The findings also show that

               approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the
               familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults,
               and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of
               multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for
               controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected
               hypotheses -the false discovery rate. This error rate is
               equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is
               smaller otherwise. There-fore, in problems where the control of
               the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is
               desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple
               sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the
               false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a
               simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial.
               The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the
               criterion are illustrated with examples.",

               Comparisons Using R describes the common underlying theory of
               multiple comparison procedures through numerous examples. It
               also presents a detailed description of available software
               implementations in R. The R packages and source code for the
               analyses are available at http://CRAN.R-project.org After giving
               examples of multiplicity problems, the book covers general
               concepts and basic multiple comparisons procedures, including
               the Bonferroni method and Simes' test. It then shows how to
               perform parametric multiple comparisons in standard linear
               models and general parametric models. It also introduces the
               multcomp package in R, which offers a convenient interface to
               perform multiple comparisons in a general context. Following
               this theoretical framework, the book explores applications
               involving the Dunnett test, Tukey's all pairwise comparisons,
               and general multiple contrast tests for standard regression
               models, mixed-effects models, and parametric survival models.
               The last chapter reviews other multiple comparison procedures,
               such as resampling-based procedures, methods for group
               sequential or adaptive designs, and the combination of multiple
               comparison procedures with modeling techniques. Controlling
               multiplicity in experiments ensures better decision making and
               safeguards against false claims. A self-contained introduction
               to multiple comparison procedures, this book offers strategies
               for constructing the procedures and illustrates the framework
               for multiple hypotheses testing in general parametric models. It
               is suitable for readers with R experience but limited knowledge
               of multiple comparison procedures and vice versa. See Dr. Bretz

              2 (2008) 176-196] critiqued ordinary least squares regression
              adjustment of estimated treatment effects in randomized
              experiments, using Neyman's model for randomization inference.
              Contrary to conventional wisdom, he argued that adjustment can
              lead to worsened asymptotic precision, invalid measures of
              precision, and small-sample bias. This paper shows that in
              sufficiently large samples, those problems are either minor or
              easily fixed. OLS adjustment cannot hurt asymptotic precision
              when a full set of treatment-covariate interactions is included.
              Asymptotically valid confidence intervals can be constructed with
              the Huber-White sandwich standard error estimator. Checks on the
              asymptotic approximations are illustrated with data from Angrist,
              Lang, and Oreopoulos's [Am. Econ. J.: Appl. Econ. 1:1 (2009)
              136-163] evaluation of strategies to improve college students'
              achievement. The strongest reasons to support Freedman's
              preference for unadjusted estimates are transparency and the
              dangers of specification search. \copyright{} 2013 Institute of

              media by different media forms and across race/ethnic groups.
              Consumption of local television news significantly elevated
              perceptions of risk and fear of crime for all groups. Crime-based
              reality programs produced equivalent fear, but the effects of
              newspaper and crime drama consumption were more variable.
              Realistic television content about crime was most influential on

              perception of race, each resume is randomly assigned either a
              very African American sounding name or a very White sounding
              name. The results show significant discrimination against
              African-American names: White names receive 50 percent more
              callbacks for interviews. We also find that race affects the
              benefits of a better resume. For White names, a higher quality
              resume elicits 30 percent more callbacks whereas for African
              Americans, it elicits a far smaller increase. Applicants living
              in better neighborhoods receive more callbacks but,
              interestingly, this effect does not differ by race. The amount of
              discrimination is uniform across occupations and industries.
              Federal contractors and employers who list Equal Opportunity
              Employer in their ad discriminate as much as other employers. We
              find little evidence that our results are driven by employers
              inferring something other than race, such as social class, from
              the names. These results suggest that racial discrimination is

               ingrained, requiring intense intervention to lastingly reduce.
               Here, we show that a single approximately 10-minute conversation
               encouraging actively taking the perspective of others can
               markedly reduce prejudice for at least 3 months. We illustrate
               this potential with a door-to-door canvassing intervention in
               South Florida targeting antitransgender prejudice. Despite
               declines in homophobia, transphobia remains pervasive. For the
               intervention, 56 canvassers went door to door encouraging active
               perspective-taking with 501 voters at voters' doorsteps. A
               randomized trial found that these conversations substantially
               reduced transphobia, with decreases greater than Americans'
               average decrease in homophobia from 1998 to 2012. These effects
               persisted for 3 months, and both transgender and nontransgender
               canvassers were effective. The intervention also increased
               support for a nondiscrimination law, even after exposing voters

  abstract = "Identifying causal mechanisms is a fundamental goal of social
              science. Researchers seek to study not only whether one variable
              affects another but also how such a causal relationship arises.
              Yet commonly used statistical methods for identifying causal
              mechanisms rely upon untestable assumptions and are often
              inappropriate even under those assumptions. Randomizing treatment
              and intermediate variables is also insufficient. Despite these
              difficulties, the study of causal mechanisms is too important to
              abandon. We make three contributions to improve research on
              causal mechanisms. First, we present a minimum set of assumptions
              required under standard designs of experimental and observational
              studies and develop a general algorithm for estimating causal
              mediation effects. Second, we provide a method for assessing the
              sensitivity of conclusions to potential violations of a key
              assumption. Third, we offer alternative research designs for
              identifying causal mechanisms under weaker assumptions. The
              proposed approach is illustrated using media framing experiments
              and incumbency advantage studies. \copyright{} 2011 American

              party affiliations based on a Bayesian assimilation of new
              information, Achen (1992) showed that a revisionist model of
              party identification generates, among its empirical implications,
              stable partisanship among adults. The model further implies that
              susceptibility to partisan change declines with age. The
              significance of Achen's model for the study of party
              identification leads us to examine more closely its underlying
              assumptions and the empirical ramifications of this and other
              learning models. Method: This essay develops a more general
              learning model, based upon the Kalman filter, that encompasses
              the Achen model as a special case. Results: We show that the
              Achen assumption of a fixed party benefit level leads to
              implausible implications about how voters learn from the history
              of party performance. When party benefit levels are allowed to
              vary over time, models of voter learning no longer imply that
              partisan attitudes, even among the older segments of the
              population, remain stable in the wake of new information about
              the parties. We conclude by discussing the empirical viability of
              our revised learning model and its implications for the study of

  abstract  = "In the Regression Discontinuity (RD) design, units are assigned
               a treatment based on whether their value of an observed
               covariate is above or below a fixed cutoff. Under the assumption
               that the distribution of potential confounders changes
               continuously around the cutoff, the discontinuous jump in the
               probability of treatment assignment can be used to identify the
               treatment effect. Although a recent strand of the RD literature
               advocates interpreting this design as a local randomized
               experiment, the standard approach to estimation and inference is
               based solely on continuity assumptions that do not justify this
               interpretation. In this article, we provide precise conditions
               in a randomization inference context under which this
               interpretation is directly justified and develop exact
               finite-sample inference procedures based on them. Our
               randomization inference framework is motivated by the
               observation that only a few observations might be available
               close enough to the threshold where local randomization is
               plausible, and hence standard large-sample procedures may be
               suspect. Our proposed methodology is intended as a complement
               and a robustness check to standard RD inference approaches. We
               illustrate our framework with a study of two measures of
               party-level advantage in U.S. Senate elections, where the number
               of close races is small and our framework is well suited for the

  abstract = "A venerable supposition of American survey research is that the
              vast majority of voters have incoherent and unstable preferences
              about political issues, which in turn have little impact on vote
              choice. We demonstrate that these findings are manifestations of
              measurement error associated with individual survey items. First,
              we show that averaging a large number of survey items on the same
              broadly defined issue area - for example, government involvement
              in the economy, or moral issues - eliminates a large amount of
              measurement error and reveals issue preferences that are well
              structured and stable. This stability increases steadily as the
              number of survey items increases and can approach that of party
              identification. Second, we show that once measurement error has
              been reduced through the use of multiple measures, issue
              preferences have much greater explanatory power in models of
              presidential vote choice, again approaching that of party

  abstract = "The disproportionate presence of blacks in American prisons,
              jails, and Death Rows, and the principal reasons for it - higher
              rates of commission of violent crimes and racially disparate
              effects of drug policies and sentencing laws governing violent
              and drug crimes - are well known. Since die late 1980s, black
              involvement in violent crime has declined substantially, but
              racial disproportions have not. Blacks are six to seven times
              more likely than whites to be in prison. Nearly a third of young
              black men are under criminal justice system control. A third of
              black boys born in 2001 are predicted to spend some time in
              prison. The simplest explanation for these patterns is that drug
              and sentencing policies that contribute to disparities have not
              been significantly changed in decades. The question then is, why
              not? The answer is that the white majority does not empathize
              with poor black people who wind up in prison. That in turn is
              because recent punishment policies have replaced the urban
              ghetto, Jim Crow laws, and slavery as a mechanism for maintaining
              white dominance over blacks in the United States. \copyright{}

  abstract  = "Using data from 6070 U.S. heterosexual internet dating profiles,
               this study examines how racial and gender exclusions are
               revealed in the preferences of black, Latino, Asian and white
               online daters. Consistent with social exchange and group
               positions theories, the study finds that whites are least open
               to out-dating and that, unlike blacks, Asians and Latinos have
               patterns of racial exclusion similar to those of whites. Like
               blacks, higher earning groups including Asian Indians, Middle
               Easterners and Asian men are highly excluded, suggesting that
               economic incorporation may not mirror acceptance in intimate
               settings. Finally, racial exclusion in dating is gendered; Asian
               males and black females are more highly excluded than their
               opposite-sex counterparts, suggesting that existing theories of
               race relations need to be expanded to account for gendered
               racial acceptance. Scholars argue that recent U.S. demographic
               changes are replacing our historically binary race relations
               system with a more complicated system of racial stratification,
               in which Latinos, Asian Americans, Middle Easterners and Asian
               Indians enjoy a status different from both whites and blacks
               (Bonilla-Silva 2004; Gans 1999; Lee and Bean 2007). Such racial
               boundaries and hierarchies are reflected not only in the
               economic and structural realm, but also in the domain of
               intimacy (Blumer 1958). However, limited research has explored
               the complexity of racial exclusion in multiethnic romantic
               settings. Using a sample of internet dating profiles, we examine
               racial exclusion by whites, blacks, Asians and Latinos within
               the realm of heterosexual romantic relationships. Our analyses
               shed light on the social distance that groups feel towards one
               another in the domain of intimacy, revealing how willing
               different groups are to cross racial boundaries, and which
               racial-gender groups are most included and excluded. Our
               approach contributes to the understanding of interracial
               relations in several ways. First, examining stated acceptance of
               other racial-ethnic groups as dates may overcome some of the
               limitations in using actual pairings or abstract attitudes to
               measure social distance between racial groups. Marriage and
               dating outcomes are influenced by both preferences and
               opportunities, but cannot distinguish between the two. On the
               other hand, surveys of attitudes and social distance scales are
               limited to hypothetical scenarios (Bogardus 1968; Yancey 2003).
               In contrast, our data provide a rare opportunity to examine
               people's stated preferences in a real-life situation. Second,
               the literature on interracial dating and racial boundaries
               generally focuses on white-minority relationships, ignoring We

               extent to which whites and minorities are willing to include
               Asian Indians and Middle Easterners as possible dates. Third, we
               move beyond existing theories of racial-ethnic relations by
               considering how racial preferences differ by gender.",

  abstract  = "H ow does geography shape democratic politics? And how is the
               answer to that question complicated by race? These broad
               questions have danced at the edges of American community studies
               and politics for a century, from Sombart's (1976) first inkling
               that ethnic diversity might undermine proletarian solidarity,
               through the dramatic and violent backlashes during the arrival
               of black Americans to northern cities during the Great
               Migration, through the white flight exodus of the late
               midcentury, and now into our new era of even more ethnoracially
               kaleido-scopic metropolitan life. For more than a half century,
               social scientists have been trying to unravel the complicated
               relationships between social context, political outcomes, and
               public policy, and all the while those same factors have been
               changing America and one another faster than we can keep up.
               Questions asked and lessons learned in this area are more
               important than ever, as globalization, continued urbanization ,
               and social friction accelerate in the United States and around
               the world. It is not easy to make important original
               contributions in these debates, but Jessica Trounstine, Clayton
               Nall, and Ryan Enos have each done so with their new books. Each
               of these works is of the ``straight to the syllabus'' class, for
               the clarity of argument and the creativity with which they
               generate and test their theories about how places and politics
               are made. Individually, each poses well-reasoned theories to
               advance our knowledge of important social processes and tests
               these theories with analyses of deceptive felicity-deceptive
               because an incredible amount of research and labor lies behind
               their slim volumes. Collectively, they make invaluable
               contributions to explain how we got to where we are and what to
               expect now that we are here. Before digging into the specific
               contributions of each piece, we can situate this burst of
               scholarly energy as part of a spatial turn that spans academic
               disciplines. Driven in part by the increasing accessibility and
               intuitively illustrative power of geographic information
               technology, an ever-growing community of scholars is asking
               questions that begin with and can be at least partially answered
               with maps. Trounstine begins her tale with a compelling
               comparison of adjacent New Jersey towns, and her geographic lens
               adjusts its focus to show the expansion of how local
               institutions segregate groups across the American city. Nall
               cleverly uses highway maps overlaid onto more conventional (but
               still spatially located, at the center or the periphery)
               measures of population and voting behavior to analyze the
               surprising effects of policies that help us move through that
               space. Enos is most explicit about this approach, building his
               argument in part on a deep human propensity toward relying on
               ``maps in our heads'' to navigate the world, and he pays close
               attention to the dimensions of space in defining context. Each
               of these accounts relies not only on the kinds of data that can
               be rectangularized and shuffled (i.e., with independent
               observations, although they do include these more conventional
               kinds of data) but also on the kinds of insights we can draw
               when we consider objects relationally and spatially, either in
               terms of their unique position relative to each other or in
               light of the other spatial characteristics they bear (distance
               from something else, density, clustering). The increasing
               frequency of this kind of political analysis is a salutary
               development.",

               social identity and interdependence/common fate). Brewer (among
               others) distinguishes between demographic- and role-based group
               memberships claiming that the latter are not related to
               collective action. Huddy and others disagree, stating that any
               group has the potential to become politicized (example of MADD).
               Political cohesion ``the existence of shared attitudes beliefs,
               and behavior among group members that can be directly attributed
               to group membership.'' o Cognitive approach (Turner, Hogg):
               Focus on self-categorization, want to emulate attitudes and
               behavior of typical group members, perceptions of in/outgroups
               enhance conformity and thus cohesion most pronounced when
               identity is salient. Identities vary because the salience of
               social categories varies across situations constantly switching
               between an individual and a social identity. Cohesion among
               members of any salient group. o Realistic interest approach
               (Blumer, Bobo): Includes realistic group conflict, relative
               deprivation, and social dominance theories. Focuses on how
               political actions lead to group-based gains and losses.
               Self-interest has been shown to have limited effects on
               preferences, mainly showing up when the effect is large, clear,
               and certain. Cohesion among members who share a common fate. o
               Social identity theory (Tajfel, Turner): Focuses on political
               power of group members' declining status. Has split into social
               identity theory and self-categorization theory (precursor to 1).
               Higher-status groups are more likely to be cohesive than
               lower-status groups due to need for a positive group identity.
               Cohesion among widely stigmatized groups. o Social
               constructivism (Erikson, Huddy): Focuses on the subjective
               meaning of identities (constructed through social processes
               including elite manipulation) and the influence on members'
               political outlooks and actions. Cohesion among members who share
               a common understanding of group membership. Ways to measure
               identity o Felt group closeness problematic because it only
               allows ID with one group, doesn't gauge common fate, and doesn't
               allow for sympathy with groups you don't belong to o Direct
               question asking whether you are a feminist, for example, works
               best if it allows for gradient of 'belonging' o Open-ended
               questions o Group assignment in experimental setting doesn't
               allow for identity strength or move beyond the lab o Multi-item
               scales such as the collective self-esteem (CSE) scale o Implicit
               attitudes Sources of political cohesion o Can be as simple as
               belonging to the same group, even if that group is assigned. o
               Strong, subjective group identity support for policies that
               benefit the group is stronger among strong group identifiers, as
               is animosity toward outgroups and opposition to policies that
               benefit majority outgroups, strong identity is also associated
               with group-related political action and with resistance to
               changes in context. o Shared meaning of group membership meaning
               can come either through social characteristics (image,
               lifestyle) or through common values, political consequences of
               an identity are important (ID with gay movement rather than just

  abstract = "We present a framework for analyzing ``model persuasion.''
              Persuaders influence receivers' beliefs by proposing models
              (likelihood functions) that specify how to organize past data
              (e.g., on investment performance) to make predictions (e.g.,
              about future returns). Receivers are assumed to find models more
              compelling when they better explain the data, fixing receivers'
              prior beliefs over states of the world. A key tradeoff facing
              persuaders is that models that better fit the data induce less
              movement in receivers' beliefs. Model persuasion sometimes makes
              the receiver worse off than he would be in the absence of
              persuasion. Even when the receiver is exposed to the true model,
              the wrong model often wins because it better fits the past. The
              receiver is most misled by persuasion when there is a lot of data
              that is open to interpretation and exhibits randomness, as this
              gives the persuader ``wiggle room'' to highlight false patterns.
              With multiple persuaders, competition pushes towards models that
              provide overly good fits, which tend to neutralize the data by
              leading receivers to view it as unsurprising. With multiple
              receivers, a persuader is more effective when he can send
              tailored, private messages than a menu of public messages. We
              illustrate with examples from finance, business, politics, and
              law.",

               Issue 2007 f) Product Description This is a graduate level
               textbook on measure theory and probability theory. The book can
               be used as a text for a two semester sequence of courses in
               measure theory and probability theory, with an option to include
               supplemental material on stochastic processes and special
               topics. It is intended primarily for first year Ph.D. students
               in mathematics and statistics although mathematically advanced
               students from engineering and economics would also find the book
               useful. Prerequisites are kept to the minimal level of an
               understanding of basic real analysis concepts such as limits,
               continuity, differentiability, Riemann integration, and
               convergence of sequences and series. A review of this material
               is included in the appendix. The book starts with an informal
               introduction that provides some heuristics into the abstract
               concepts of measure and integration theory, which are then
               rigorously developed. The first part of the book can be used for
               a standard real analysis course for both mathematics and
               statistics Ph.D. students as it provides full coverage of topics
               such as the construction of Lebesgue-Stieltjes measures on real
               line and Euclidean spaces, the basic convergence theorems, L p
               spaces, signed measures, Radon-Nikodym theorem, Lebesgue's
               decomposition theorem and the fundamental theorem of Lebesgue
               integration on R, product spaces and product measures, and
               Fubini-Tonelli theorems. It also provides an elementary
               introduction to Banach and Hilbert spaces, convolutions, Fourier
               series and Fourier and Plancherel transforms. Thus part I would
               be particularly useful for students in a typical Statistics
               Ph.D. program if a separate course on real analysis is not a
               standard requirement. Part II (chapters 6-13) provides full
               coverage of standard graduate level probability theory. It
               starts with Kolmogorov's probability model and Kolmogorov's
               existence theorem. It then treats thoroughly the laws of large
               numbers including renewal theory and ergodic theorems with
               applications and then weak convergence of probability
               distributions, characteristic functions, the Levy-Cramer
               continuity theorem and the central limit theorem as well as
               stable laws. It ends with conditional expectations and
               conditional probability, and an introduction to the theory of
               discrete time martingales. Part III (chapters 14-18) provides a
               modest coverage of discrete time Markov chains with countable
               and general state spaces, MCMC, continuous time discrete space
               jump Markov processes, Brownian motion, mixing sequences,
               bootstrap methods, and branching processes. It could be used for
               a topics/seminar course or as an introduction to stochastic
               processes. From the reviews: ``...There are interesting and

              experiments randomized door-to-door visits at the individual
              level, the scale of this campaign (five million doors knocked)
              enabled randomization by precinct, the level at which vote shares
              are recorded administratively. Visits did not affect turnout, but
              increased Hollande's vote share in the first round and accounted
              for one-fourth of his victory margin in the second. Visits'
              impact persisted in later elections, suggesting a lasting
              persuasion effect. (JEL C93, D7, D83) Consumers and voters base
              their economic and political decisions on preferences and beliefs
              shaped by their direct observations, the communication they
              receive, and discussions with others. Interpersonal discussions
              contribute to the spread of information and peer effects in
              technology adoption (e.g., Foster and Rosenzweig 1995; Conley and
              Udry 2010), educational choices (e.g., Bobonis and Finan 2009),
              or financial decisions (e.g., Duflo and Saez 2003; Banerjee et
              al. 2013), and political discussions are commonly seen as the
              healthy expression of a functioning democracy. To the extent that
              democracy revolves around the deliberation and transformation of
              people's preferences, rather than the simple aggregation of their
              votes, discussion may actually be as important a condition of
              democracy as the electoral participation of all citizens
              (Habermas 1996; Elster 1998). The importance people attach to
              political discussions is illustrated by DellaVigna et al.'s
              (2017) result that many of us vote in order to later be able ``to
              tell others.'' But discussions also affect future political
              behavior. In their pioneering study on the 1940 US presidential
              election, Lazarsfeld et al. (1944) find that most voters got
              their information about the candidates from family members,
              friends, and colleagues, rather than from the media (see also
              Gentzkow and Shapiro 2011). Nickerson (2008) and Bond et al.
              (2012) provide direct evidence of the diffusion of voter turnout

  title    = "{Does Counter-Attitudinal Information Cause Backlash? Results from
              Three Large Survey Experiments}",
  author   = "Guess, Andrew and Coppock, Alexander",
  abstract = "Several theoretical perspectives suggest that when individuals
              are exposed to counter-attitudinal evidence or arguments, their
              pre-existing opinions and beliefs are reinforced, resulting in a
              phenomenon sometimes known as 'backlash'. This article formalizes
              the concept of backlash and specifies how it can be measured. It
              then presents the results from three survey experiments-two on
              Mechanical Turk and one on a nationally representative
              sample-that find no evidence of backlash, even under
              theoretically favorable conditions. While a casual reading of the
              literature on information processing suggests that backlash is
              rampant, these results indicate that it is much rarer than
              commonly supposed. If people of opposing views can each find
              support for those views in the same body of evidence, it is small
              wonder that social science research […] will frequently fuel
              rather than calm the fires of debate.-Lord et al. (1979) For
              several decades, research on public opinion and information
              processing has presented a challenge for believers in
              evidence-based decision making. Its prognosis for the body
              politic is dire: instead of prompting a reconsideration of
              long-held views, counter-attitudinal evidence may actually
              strengthen pre-existing beliefs, resulting in polarization. This
              prediction of backlash is associated with numerous theoretical
              perspectives and has led to an emerging consensus among scholars
              that attempts to persuade voters, challenge opponents or correct
              factual misperceptions can often result in the opposite of the
              intended effect. According to this consensus, people
              work-consciously or not-to protect their worldviews via a series
              of complementary belief-preserving mechanisms (Kunda 1990).
              Examples include the prior attitude effect, the tendency to
              perceive evidence and arguments that support one's views as
              stronger and more persuasive than those that challenge them;
              disconfirmation bias, in which people exert effort to
              counter-argue vigorously against evidence that is not congruent
              with their beliefs; and various forms of selective exposure and
              selective attention to congenial information, sometimes referred
              to as confirmation bias (Taber and Lodge 2006). The cumulative
              effect of these mechanisms is polarization. People exposed to the
              same information may respond by strengthening their pre-existing
              views. The canonical explication and demonstration of these
              mechanisms appears in Lord et al. (1979), in which both pro-and
              anti-death-penalty college students were exposed to mixed

  abstract  = "Significance Between the 1970s and the late 2000s, the United
               States experienced an enormous rise in incarceration, a
               substantial portion of which was caused by high rates of return
               to prison among those previously incarcerated. This study shows
               that such returns are primarily a product of postprison
               community supervision rather than criminogenic effects of
               imprisonment, as many individuals sentenced to prison become
               trapped in the escalating surveillance and punishment of the
               criminal justice system. In other words, the rise in
               incarceration in the United States in the late 20th and early
               21st centuries was in part a self-perpetuating process resulting
               from the workings of the criminal justice system itself.
               Abstract A substantial contributor to prison admissions is the
               return of individuals recently released from prison, which has
               come to be known as prison's ``revolving door.'' However, it is
               unclear whether being sentenced to prison itself has a causal
               effect on the probability of a subsequent return to prison or on
               criminal behavior. To examine the causal effect of being
               sentenced to prison on subsequent offending and reimprisonment,
               we leverage a natural experiment using the random assignment of
               judges with different propensities for sentencing offenders to
               prison. Drawing on data on all individuals sentenced for a
               felony in Michigan between 2003 and 2006, we compare individuals
               sentenced to prison to those sentenced to probation, taking into
               account sentence lengths and stratifying our analysis by race.
               Results show that being sentenced to prison rather than
               probation increases the probability of imprisonment in the first
               3 years after release from prison by 18 percentage points among
               nonwhites and 19 percentage points among whites. Further results
               show that such effects are driven primarily by imprisonment for
               technical violations of community supervision rather than new
               felony convictions. This suggests that more stringent postprison
               parole supervision (relative to probation supervision) increases
               imprisonment through the detection and punishment of low-level
               offending or violation behavior. Such behavior would not
               otherwise result in imprisonment for someone who had not already
               been to prison or who was not on parole. These results
               demonstrate that the revolving door of prison is in part an
               effect of the nature of postprison supervision.",

              I n r ecen t dec a de s, American politics has been dominated, at
              least rhetorically, by a battle over the size of government. But
              that is not what the next few decades of our politics will be
              about. With the frontiers of the state roughly fixed, the issues
              that will define our major debates will concern the complexity of
              government, rather than its sheer scope. With that complexity has
              also come incoherence. Conservatives over the last few years have
              increasingly worried that America is, in Friedrich Hayek's
              ominous terms, on the road to serfdom. But this concern as-cribes
              vastly greater purpose and design to our approach to public
              policy than is truly warranted. If anything, we have arrived at a
              form of govern-ment with no ideological justification whatsoever.
              The complexity and incoherence of our government often make it
              difficult for us to understand just what that government is
              doing, and among the practices it most frequently hides from view
              is the grow-ing tendency of public policy to redistribute
              resources upward to the wealthy and the organized at the expense
              of the poorer and less orga-nized. As we increasingly notice the
              consequences of that regressive redistribution, we will
              inevitably also come to pay greater attention to the daunting and
              self-defeating complexity of public policy across mul-tiple,
              seemingly unrelated areas of American life, and so will need to
              start thinking differently about government. Understanding,
              describing, and addressing this problem of complex-ity and
              incoherence is the next great American political challenge. But
              you cannot come to terms with such a problem until you can
              prop-erly name it. While we can name the major questions that
              divide our Nat iona l Affa ir s · Fa l l 2013 98 politics ---
              liberalism or conservatism, big government or small --- we have
              no name for the dispute between complexity and simplicity in
              gov-ernment, which cuts across those more familiar ideological
              divisions. For lack of a better alternative, the problem of
              complexity might best be termed the challenge of `` kludgeocracy.
              '' A `` kludge '' is defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as
              `` an ill-assorted collection of parts assembled to fulfill a
              particular purpose . . . a clumsy but temporarily effective
              solution to a particular fault or prob-lem. '' The term comes out
              of the world of computer programming, where a kludge is an
              inelegant patch put in place to solve an unexpected problem and
              designed to be backward-compatible with the rest of an existing
              system. When you add up enough kludges, you get a very
              com-plicated program that has no clear organizing principle, is
              exceedingly difficult to understand, and is subject to crashes.
              Any user of Microsoft Windows will immediately grasp the concept.
              `` Clumsy but temporarily effective '' also describes much of
              American public policy today. To see policy kludges in action,
              one need look no further than the mind-numbing complexity of the
              health-care system (which even Obamacare's champions must admit
              has only grown more complicated under the new law, even if in
              their view the system is now also more just), or our byzantine
              system of funding higher education, or our bewildering
              federal-state system of governing everything from wel-fare to
              education to environmental regulation. America has chosen to
              govern itself through more indirect and incoherent policy
              mechanisms than can be found in any comparable country. The
              effects of this approach to public policy are widespread and
              pro-found. But to understand how to treat our government's
              ailment, we first need to understand the symptoms, the character,
              and the causes of that ailment. t he costs of comple x i t y",

              project is the first major opportunity to use a behavioral
              economics lens to look at programs that serve poor and vulnerable
              people in the United States. Sponsored by the Office of Planning,
              Research and Evaluation of the Administration for Children and
              Families (ACF) within the U.S. Department of Health and Human
              Services, the BIAS project aims to learn how tools from
              behavioral economics can improve the well-being of individuals
              and families served by programs that ACF supports. Many human
              services programs require clients to make active decisions and
              follow a series of steps in order to reap a benefit--from
              deciding to apply, to completing forms, to arranging for child
              care. Program designers often assume that individuals will
              carefully consider options, make decisions that maximize their
              well-being, and diligently follow through. Behavioral economics,
              which combines insights from psychology and economics, may help
              explain why these assumptions are not always borne out. By
              describing work in three sites, this report illustrates how the
              BIAS project draws on the principles of behavioral economics to
              design solutions for ACF programs. In partnership with program
              administrators, the BIAS team uses a method called ``behavioral
              diagnosis and design'' to delve into problems that program
              administrators have identified, diagnose potential bottlenecks
              that may inhibit program performance, and identify areas where a
              relatively easy and low-cost, behaviorally informed change might
              improve outcomes. Working with the Texas Office of the Attorney
              General's Child Support Division, the BIAS team explored ways to
              increase the number of incarcerated noncustodial parents who
              apply for a modification of their child support order, with the
              goal of preventing further accrual of child support arrears. The
              project team also engaged with the Illinois Department of Human
              Services and one of its job search contractors to identify
              behavioral interventions that could help increase the rate of
              engagement in job search assistance among clients who receive
              Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. Finally, work with the
              National Domestic Violence Hotline (NDVH) focused on reducing the
              number of callers who reach a hold message but hang up before
              talking to an NDVH staffer. Working with the Texas Office of the

              (1) The behavioral diagnosis and design process provides a means
              of identifying and addressing key reasons that programs may not
              be performing to expectation. The process can uncover behavioral
              bottlenecks that are amenable to behavioral solutions. It may
              also identify structural issues, such as a need to hire more
              staff, which are often outside the scope of the BIAS project. (2)
              The diagnosis process encourages program designers to step back
              and examine multiple possible explanations for underperformance
              before embracing a particular theory or solution. This may
              improve the likelihood of success of any behavioral intervention.
              As the project moves forward, the BIAS team will continue to work
              with public officials to design and apply behavioral
              interventions in ACF program areas to generate new ways of
              tackling problems. Promising interventions will be tested using
              rigorous research designs, employing experimental methods to
              reliably determine the impact of an intervention. Future
              publications will report the impacts of these interventions.

              Lori",
  abstract = "Over the past quarter-century, private pension plans in the
              United States have trended toward a do-it-yourself approach in
              which covered workers bear more invest-ment risk and make more
              decisions themselves about their retirement savings. Some workers
              have thrived under this more individualized approach, amassing
              siz-able balances in 401(k) plans and similar plans that will
              assure them a comfortable and relatively secure retire-ment
              income. For others, however, the 401(k) revolution has fallen
              short of its potential. Work, family, and other more immediate
              competing demands often distract workers from the need to save
              and invest for the future. Those who do take the time to consider
              their choices find the decisions they face to be quite complex:
              Individual financial planning is seldom a simple task. For many
              workers, the result is poor decisionmaking at each stage of the
              retirement saving process, putting the level and security of
              their retirement income at risk. Even worse, in the face of those
              difficult choices, many people simply procrastinate and thereby
              avoid dealing with the issues altogether, dramatically raising
              the likelihood that they will save inadequate amounts for
              retirement. A disarmingly simple concept --- what we call the
              automatic 401(k) --- has the potential to cut through that
              Gordian knot and improve retirement security for mil-lions of
              workers via a set of common-sense reforms. In a nutshell, the
              automatic 401(k) consists of changing the default option at each
              phase of the 401(k) savings cycle to make sound saving and
              investment decisions the norm, even, and especially, when the
              worker never gets around to making a choice in the first place.
              Given the current structure of most 401(k) plans, workers do not
              participate unless they actively choose to. In contrast, under an
              automatic 401(k) they would participate unless they ac-tively
              choose not to --- and similarly for each major decision
              thereafter. Contributions would be made, in-creased gradually
              over time, invested prudently, and preserved for retirement, all
              without putting the onus on workers to take the initiative for
              any of those steps. At the same time, however, workers would
              remain free to override the default options --- to choose whether
              or not to save, and to control how their savings are invested ---
              but those who fail to exercise the initiative would not be left
              behind. The steps involved in building an automatic 401(k) are
              not complicated and the benefits could be substantial; indeed, a
              growing body of empirical evidence suggests that the automatic
              401(k) may be the most promising approach to bolstering
              retirement security for millions of American families. A number
              of economists have under-taken important research and contributed
              practical sug-gestions concerning the actual and potential uses
              of automatic enrollment and related default arrangements in
              401(k) plans. 1 Drawing on their contributions, this article

              ex-emplars. The theory claims that the two systems devel-oped to
              fulfill different functional roles and in turn have distinct
              evolutionary histories. The experiential system is the older of
              the two, operating in humans and nonhu-mans, and although crude,
              it processes information ef-fortlessly. The analytic system has a
              relatively short evo-lutionary history, is unique to humans, and
              was developed to operate in the medium of language. Early
              research on human judgment and decision making provided much
              evidence to suggest that there were com-peting modes of thought,
              one of which is intuitive and the other extensional, and that
              they led to entirely different types of responses (e.g., Hammond
              \& Summers, 1972; Tversky \& Kahneman, 1983). Tversky and
              Kahneman (1974) claimed that intuitive type reasoning is informal
              and unstructured, and relies on heuristics that include such
              computations as similarity, representativeness (i.e., the
              assessment of the degree of correspondence between a sample and a
              population), and attributions of causality. Tversky and Kahneman
              shared Epstein's (1973, 1994) view that the information the
              system acts upon is content specific and affective, whereas
              extensional reasoning is controlled, slow, and deliberate and
              acts as a regulator monitoring intuitive responses that it can
              choose to en-dorse or override. Early dual-process theories led
              to a diverse set of as-sumptions about the nature and origins of
              the different types of reasoning identified. While the research
              programs developed from them center on different aspects of human
              behavior, the basic claims made are the same. The basis for
              proposing separate reasoning systems stems from the view that
              experiences are ordered very differently ac-cording to how they
              are used to reason about the world. Experiences are arranged such
              that they form initial in-tuitive understandings of the world
              that, when organized, can be used to control and manipulate
              certain mental ac-tivities. These two alternative uses result in
              differences in the way information is encoded, differences in
              behav-ior, and differences in expressible knowledge. This article
              focuses on three of the most influential dual-process theories
              currently pervading a wide range of work on thinking and
              reasoning. To begin, these theories will be described more
              thoroughly in terms of their characteriza-tion of the two
              processes, the functions they serve, and the type of information
              they encode. In the remainder of this section, connections are
              drawn across the theories and then discussed. Included in this
              section is the first of two ap-praisals of the dual-process
              account, to provide some eval-uation of the actual theoretical
              proposals made. At the end of this article comes the second
              evaluation, in which the theories are reviewed in relation to

  title     = "{The behavioral foundations of public policy}",
  author    = "Shafir, Eldar",
  abstract  = "In recent years, remarkable progress has been made in behavioral
               research on a wide variety of topics, from behavioral finance,
               labor contracts, philanthropy, and the analysis of savings and
               poverty, to eyewitness identification and sentencing decisions,
               racism, sexism, health behaviors, and voting. Research findings
               have often been strikingly counterintuitive, with serious
               implications for public policymaking. In this book, leading
               experts in psychology, decision research, policy analysis,
               economics, political science, law, medicine, and philosophy
               explore major trends, principles, and general insights about
               human behavior in policy-relevant settings. Their work provides
               a deeper understanding of the many drivers--cognitive, social,
               perceptual, motivational, and emotional--that guide behaviors in
               everyday settings. They give depth and insight into the methods
               of behavioral research, and highlight how this knowledge might
               influence the implementation of public policy for the
               improvement of society. This collection examines the policy
               relevance of behavioral science to our social and political
               lives, to issues ranging from health, environment, and
               nutrition, to dispute resolution, implicit racism, and false
               convictions. The book illuminates the relationship between
               behavioral findings and economic analyses, and calls attention
               to what policymakers might learn from this vast body of
               groundbreaking work. Wide-ranging investigation into people's
               motivations, abilities, attitudes, and perceptions finds that
               they differ in profound ways from what is typically assumed. The
               result is that public policy acquires even greater significance,
               since rather than merely facilitating the conduct of human
               affairs, policy actually shapes their trajectory. The first
               interdisciplinary look at behaviorally informed policymaking.

  abstract  = "Observations from the UK's No. 10 Cabinet Office Behavioural
               Insights Team Behavioural insights is, in essence, quite a
               simple idea: if we adopt more sophisticated models of what it is
               that drives human behaviour---including judgements of risk and
               what people actually do---we might make better policy which is
               easier, more effective, and more cost effective too. It is
               important to note from the outset that we use behavioural
               insights (rather than behavioural economics) to refer to that
               range of literature about human behaviour from behavioural
               economics, social psychology, neuroscience and sociology. We
               prefer the term 'behavioural insights' mainly because it is less
               doctrinal, and I know that there are many psychologists out
               there who feel that MANAGING UNDER AUSTERITy, DELIvERING UNDER
               PRESSURE 166 'behavioural economics' has been appropriated by
               economists to the exclusion of psychologists. The UK Cabinet
               Office team feel that 'behavioural insights' is a broader, more
               encompassing term. The Conservative--Liberal Democrat coalition
               government in Britain, particularly in 2010, brought this idea
               forward---that we could support and help people make better
               choices for themselves. It has been our brief for almost four
               years now, and we have had some fantastic results. Nuts and
               bolts changes There are two kinds of projects we do. One is
               'nuts and bolts' changes, some of which have been quite long in
               the design and making. An example is a 2012 change to the
               defaults on employer-funded pensions (superannuation). We moved
               from an opt-in system to an opt-out system for employer
               pensions, leading to about 90 per cent of people staying in the
               system. It is a remarkable result. For decades, people have
               struggled to get the savings rate up of workers, and simply by
               changing the default we have achieved this remarkable effect. We
               are by no means the only ones in the world to do this, but it is
               still powerful and gratifying to see it working. There are other
               examples I can mention. We have run many randomised control
               trials to test the effects of small 'nudges' across a number of
               areas of domestic policy. One great success has been our
               initiative to change the letters issued by our tax office,
               Inland Revenue. Our tax authorities write millions of tax
               letters every year. We found that small changes in the
               wording---for example, telling people something that is true:
               'most people pay their tax on time'---can be a very effective
               way of encouraging people to pay their tax. Even a small
               variation on that---saying 'most people in your area have paid
               their tax and you are one of the few that are yet to
               pay'---turns out to be a very effective way of increasing
               compliance and tax rates. Interestingly, it also reduces the
               number of complaints. The marginal cost of these changes is
               almost zero, and they are now bringing in hundreds of millions
               of pounds in forward payment on tax in the UK.",

              mon-itoring in Afghanistan to vocational training programs. This

              address economic, political, and social challenges, but that
              knowledge has been developed primarily in places with certain
              governance characteristics. Using data from a nearly-complete
              enumeration of RCTs in political science and economics conducted
              since 1995, we show that the sample of RCT locations in non-OECD
              countries is skewed towards countries that are poorer than
              average, but that are also relatively democratic and spend more
              on citizen welfare. Only 20\% of RCTs have been conducted in
              autocratic states, the kinds of places where roughly 35\% of the

               treating all school children at regular intervals with deworming
               drugs in areas where helminth infection is common. As the
               intervention is often claimed to have important health,
               nutrition, and societal effects beyond the removal of worms, we
               critically evaluated the evidence on benefits. OBJECTIVES To
               summarize the effects of giving deworming drugs to children to
               treat soil-transmitted helminths on weight, haemoglobin, and
               cognition; and the evidence of impact on physical well-being,
               school attendance, school performance, and mortality. SEARCH
               METHODS We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group
               Specialized Register (14 April 2015); Cochrane Central Register
               of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), published in the Cochrane
               Library (2015, Issue 4); MEDLINE (2000 to 14 April 2015); EMBASE
               (2000 to 14 April 2015); LILACS (2000 to 14 April 2015); the
               metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT); and reference lists,
               and registers of ongoing and completed trials up to 14 April
               2015. SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomized controlled
               trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing deworming drugs for
               soil-transmitted helminths with placebo or no treatment in
               children aged 16 years or less, reporting on weight,
               haemoglobin, and formal tests of intellectual development. We
               also sought data on school attendance, school performance, and
               mortality. We included trials that combined health education
               with deworming programmes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS At least
               two review authors independently assessed the trials, evaluated
               risk of bias, and extracted data. We analysed continuous data
               using the mean difference (MD) with 95\% confidence intervals
               (CIs). Where data were missing, we contacted trial authors. We
               used outcomes at time of longest follow-up. The evidence quality
               was assessed using GRADE. This edition of the Cochrane Review
               adds the DEVTA trial from India, and draws on an independent
               analytical replication of a trial from Kenya. MAIN RESULTS We
               identified 45 trials, including nine cluster-RCTs, that met the
               inclusion criteria. One trial evaluating mortality included over
               one million children, and the remaining 44 trials included a
               total of 67,672 participants. Eight trials were in children
               known to be infected, and 37 trials were carried out in endemic
               areas, including areas of high (15 trials), moderate (12
               trials), and low prevalence (10 trials). Treating children known
               to be infectedTreating children known to be infected with a
               single dose of deworming drugs (selected by screening, or living
               in areas where all children are infected) may increase weight
               gain over the next one to six months (627 participants, five
               trials, low quality evidence). The effect size varied across
               trials from an additional 0.2 kg gain to 1.3 kg. There is
               currently insufficient evidence to know whether treatment has
               additional effects on haemoglobin (247 participants, two trials,
               very low quality evidence); school attendance (0 trials);
               cognitive functioning (103 participants, two trials, very low
               quality evidence), or physical well-being (280 participants,
               three trials, very low quality evidence). Community deworming
               programmesTreating all children living in endemic areas with a
               dose of deworming drugs probably has little or no effect on
               average weight gain (MD 0.04 kg less, 95\% CI 0.11 kg less to
               0.04 kg more; trials 2719 participants, seven trials, moderate
               quality evidence), even in settings with high prevalence of
               infection (290 participants, two trials). A single dose also
               probably has no effect on average haemoglobin (MD 0.06 g/dL,
               95\% CI -0.05 lower to 0.17 higher; 1005 participants, three
               trials, moderate quality evidence), or average cognition (1361
               participants, two trials, low quality evidence).Similiarly,
               regularly treating all children in endemic areas with deworming
               drugs, given every three to six months, may have little or no
               effect on average weight gain (MD 0.08 kg, 95\% CI 0.11 kg less
               to 0.27 kg more; 38,392 participants, 10 trials, low quality
               evidence). The effects were variable across trials; one trial
               from a low prevalence setting carried out in 1995 found an
               increase in weight, but nine trials carried out since then found
               no effect, including five from moderate and high prevalence
               areas.There is also reasonable evidence that regular treatment
               probably has no effect on average height (MD 0.02 cm higher,
               95\% CI 0.14 lower to 0.17 cm higher; 7057 participants, seven
               trials, moderate quality evidence); average haemoglobin (MD 0.02
               g/dL lower; 95\% CI 0.08 g/dL lower to 0.04 g/dL higher; 3595
               participants, seven trials, low quality evidence); formal tests
               of cognition (32,486 participants, five trials, moderate quality
               evidence); exam performance (32,659 participants, two trials,
               moderate quality evidence); or mortality (1,005,135
               participants, three trials, low quality evidence). There is very
               limited evidence assessing an effect on school attendance and
               the findings are inconsistent, and at risk of bias (mean
               attendance 2\% higher, 95\% CI 4\% lower to 8\% higher; 20,243
               participants, two trials, very low quality evidence).In a

  abstract  = "Good self-control has been linked to adaptive outcomes such as
               better health, cohesive personal relationships, success in the
               workplace and at school, and less susceptibility to crime and
               addictions. In contrast, self-control failure is linked to
               maladaptive outcomes. Understanding the mechanisms by which
               self-control predicts behavior may assist in promoting better
               regulation and outcomes. A popular approach to understanding
               self-control is the strength or `resource depletion' model.
               Self-control is conceptualized as a limited resource which
               becomes depleted after a period of exertion resulting
               self-control failure. The model has typically been tested using
               a `sequential-task' experimental paradigm in which people
               completing an initial self-control task have reduced
               self-control capacity and poorer performance on a subsequent
               task, a state known as `ego depletion'. Although a meta-analysis
               of ego-depletion experiments found a medium-sized effect,
               subsequent meta-analyses have questioned the size and existence
               of the effect and identified instances of possible bias. The
               analyses served as a catalyst for the current registered
               replication report of the ego-depletion effect. Multiple
               laboratories (k = 23, total N = 2141) conducted replications of
               a standardized ego-depletion protocol based on a sequential-task
               paradigm by Sripada et al. Meta-analysis of the studies revealed
               that the size of the ego-depletion effect was small with 95\%
               confidence intervals that encompassed zero. We discuss
               implications of the findings for the ego-depletion effect and
               the resource depletion model of self-control.",

  abstract = "One of the key objectives of the Behavioural Insights Team at its
              creation in 2010 was to spread the understanding of behavioural
              approaches across the policy community. Alongside the policy work
              and trials conducted by the Team over the last three years, we
              have conducted many seminars, workshops and talks with policy
              makers, academics and practitioners. From these many sessions,
              together with our trials and policy work, has emerged a simple,
              pragmatic framework to help think about behaviour change. In the
              early years, we often used the MINDSPACE framework, and indeed
              some of the team were centrally involved in developing it.1 We
              still use this framework. But we found in seminars that its nine
              elements were hard for busy policy makers to keep in mind (itself
              reflecting `cognitive chunking'). At the same time, we found in
              our day-to-day trials and policy work that some of the most
              reliable effects came from changes that weren't easily captured
              by MINDSPACE, or indeed by much of the academic literature. For
              example, we have often found that simplifying messages, or
              removing even the tiniest amount of `friction' in a process, can
              have a large impact. For these reasons, we wanted to develop a
              shorter, simple mnemonic --- the EAST framework. The EAST
              framework was developed by the Behavioural Insights Team from
              early 2012. After initial testing in seminars given by members of
              the team with UK Civil Servants, the first public `outing' of
              EAST in its final form was in a short series of lectures I gave
              in Harvard and Washington later that year. Since then, we have
              refined and developed some of the core concepts and ideas, based
              on new findings and feedback from those we have tested EAST with.
              I would stress that, like most of what BIT does, it is very much
              the work of the team, and many have contributed to it -- not
              least our friend and colleague Richard Thaler whose mantra is to
              `make it easy'. We hope you find this guide helpful. Getting
              familiar with the EAST framework won't turn you into the world's
              leading expert on behavioural insight. There are more complex
              frameworks and typologies, and many subtle and fascinating
              effects that EAST does not cover. But if even a small percentage
              of policies and practices are adapted as a result, EAST should
              lead to services that are easier and more pleasant for citizens
              to use, and more effective and cheaper too.",

              policing O ver the last several years, our nation has been rocked
              by an onslaught of incidents captured on video involving police
              officers' use of force with black suspects. The images from these
              cases are disturbing, both exposing and igniting police--
              community conflict all over the country: in New York, Missouri,
              Ohio, South Carolina, Maryland, Illinois, Wisconsin, Louisiana,
              Oklahoma, and North Carolina. These images have renewed
              conversations about modern-day race relations and have led many
              to question how far we have come (1). In an effort to increase
              accountability and transparency, law enforcement agen-cies are
              adopting body-worn cameras at an extremely rapid pace (2, 3).
              Despite the rapid proliferation of body-worn cameras, no law
              enforcement agency has systematically analyzed the massive
              amounts of footage these cameras produce. Instead, the public and
              agencies alike tend to focus on the fraction of videos involv-ing
              high-profile incidents, using footage as evidence of innocence or
              guilt in individual encounters. Left unexamined are the common,
              everyday interactions between the police and the communities they
              serve. By best esti-mates, more than one quarter of the public
              (ages 16 y and over) comes into contact with the police during
              the course of a year, most frequently as the result of a
              police-initiated traffic stop (4, 5). Here, we examine body-worn
              camera footage of routine traf-fic stops in the large, racially
              diverse city of Oakland, CA. Routine traffic stops are not only
              common, they are conse-quential, each an opportunity to build or
              erode public trust in the police. Being treated with respect
              builds trust in the fairness of an officer's behavior, whereas
              rude or disrespectful treatment can erode trust (6, 7). Moreover,
              a person's experiences of respect or disrespect in personal
              interactions with police officers play a cen-tral role in their
              judgments of how procedurally fair the police are as an
              institution, as well as their willingness to support or cooperate
              with the police (8, 9). Blacks report more negative experiences
              in their interactions with the police than other groups (10).
              Across numerous studies, for example, blacks report being treated
              less fairly and respect-fully in their contacts with the police
              than whites (6, 11). Indeed, some have argued that racial
              disparities in perceived treatment during routine encounters help
              fuel the mistrust of police in the controversial officer-involved
              shootings that have received such great attention. However, do
              officers treat white commu-nity members with a greater degree of
              respect than they afford to blacks? We address this question by
              analyzing officers' language during vehicle stops of white and
              black community members. Although many factors may shape these
              interactions, an officer's words are undoubtedly critical:
              Through them, the officer can communicate respect and
              understanding of a citizen's perspec-tive, or contempt and
              disregard for their voice. Furthermore, the language of those in
              positions of institutional power (police officers, judges, work
              superiors) has greater influence over the course of the
              interaction than the language used by those with less power
              (12--16). Measuring officer language thus provides a quantitative
              lens on one key aspect of the quality or tone of
              police--community interactions, and offers new opportunities for
              advancing police training. Previous research on police--community
              interactions has relied on citizens' recollection of past
              interactions (10) or researcher observation of officer behavior
              (17--20) to assess procedural fair-ness. Although these methods
              are invaluable, they offer an indi-rect view of officer behavior
              and are limited to a small number of interactions. Furthermore,
              the very presence of researchers may influence the police
              behavior those researchers seek to measure (21).",

              in geography can be exploited as a natural experiment and review
              several assumptions under which geographic natural experiments
              yield valid causal estimates. In particular, we focus on cases
              where a geographic or administrative boundary splits units into
              treated and control areas. The different identification
              assumptions we consider suggest testable implications, which we
              use to establish their plausibility. Our methods are illustrated
              with an original study of whether ballot initiatives increase
              turnout in Wisconsin and Ohio, which illustrates the strengths
              and weaknesses of causal inferences based on geographic natural
              experiments. P olitical scientists have long used statistical
              techniques to infer causal relationships. Many advocate the use
              of experiments as the primary means of drawing causal inferences
              with statistics (Green and Gerber 2002). Given that experiments
              are often unfeasible, others advocate relying on natural
              experiments or quasi-experiments as much as possible (Sekhon
              2009). Although natural experiments are considered by many to be
              the best alternative to randomized experimentation, they are not
              without complications. This stems from the fact that, in a
              natural experiment, assignment to treatment occurs in some
              haphazard manner. Although such haphazard treatment assignment is
              typically preferable to contexts where units entirely self-select
              into their treatment status, it is very different from the
              assignment in experiments where randomization is a known fact. As
              such, natural experiments generally entail compli-cations that
              are absent when randomization is known to hold (Sekhon and
              Titiunik 2012). Although natural experiments come in a myriad of
              forms, one popular type is based on geographic variation of the
              treatment of interest, where units in a treated area are compared
              with units in a control area. In this kind of natural experiment,
              certain features of geography allow researchers to plausibly
              claim that treatment assignment is haphazard or as-if random.
              Natural experiments based on geography have been used to draw
              causal inferences about nation building, governance, and ethnic

               argue that the effective combination of all three components is
               the essence of what data science is about. data science |
               statistics | machine learning The term `` data science '' has
               attracted a lot of attention. Much of this attention is in
               business (1), in government (2), and in the academic areas of
               statistics (3, 4) and computer science (5, 6). Here, we discuss
               data science from the perspective of scientific research. What
               is data science? Why might scientists care about it? Our
               perspective is that data science is the child of statistics and
               computer science. While it has inherited some of their methods
               and thinking, it also seeks to blend them, refocus them, and
               develop them to address the context and needs of modern
               scientific data analysis. This perspective is not new. Over 50
               years ago, Tukey (7) defined `` data analysis '' as a broad
               endeavor, much broader than traditional math-ematical
               statistics. In a sense, today's data science, although set
               against a modern backdrop, is cast from Tukey's original mold.
               In modern research, scientists from diverse disci-plines are
               confronting abundant datasets and are confident that there is
               value in the data for advancing their scientific goals. We give
               three examples at genomic, social, and galactic scales. First,
               modern sequencing technology has enabled high-resolution genetic
               sequencing at massive scale, and geneticists have connected the
               genetic data to large databases of individuals' behaviors and
               diseases. These data can potentially aid researchers in studying
               the human ge-nome, helping them understand how it evolves, and
               how it governs observed traits. Second, social scien-tists now
               have the opportunity to study large archives of digitized texts,
               often with rich information about human behavior and
               interactions. These data could help them more effectively
               navigate and understand the contours of society, finding
               relevant sources to their work and identifying hard to spot
               patterns of language that suggest new interpretations and
               theo-ries. Third, modern telescopes create digital sky sur-veys
               that have transformed observational astronomy, generating
               hundreds of terabytes of raw image data about billions of sky
               objects. A catalog of these ob-jects, if available, would give
               astronomers an unprec-edented window into the structure of the
               cosmos. These examples paint a picture of what might be possible
               in the modern sciences. However, an issue that pervades many, if
               not all, scientific disciplines is that scientists cannot yet
               fully take advantage of their new data. Connecting genes and
               traits at large scale is a problem that is beyond the limits of
               classical genome analysis, both computationally and
               statisti-cally. Building tools for navigating large collections
               of documents, especially ones that reflect the priorities of
               social scientists, is a problem that is not solved by classical
               methods of document analysis. Using digital sky surveys to
               understand the complex nature of the universe requires
               computational tools and statistical assumptions beyond those
               used for the manually curated studies of earlier eras. Broadly
               speaking, there is a tension emerging--- the existing methods
               from statistics and computing are not set up to solve the types
               of problems that face modern scientists. Some issues are
               computational, such as working with massive datasets and complex
               metadata. Some issues are statistical, such as the rich
               interactions of many related variables and the",

               score matching and matching based on Mahalanobis distance are
               limiting cases of this method. The algorithm makes transparent
               certain issues that all matching methods must confront. We
               present simulation studies that show that the algorithm improves
               covariate balance and that it may reduce bias if the selection
               on observables assumption holds. We then present a reanalysis of
               a number of data sets in the LaLonde (1986) controversy.",

               experimental design but has drawbacks when a limited set of
               individuals are willing to be randomized, or the act of
               randomization undermines the success of the treatment.
               Choice-based experimental designs allow a subset of the
               participants to choose their treatments. We discuss here causal
               inferences for hybrid experimental designs in which some
               participants are randomly allocated to treatments and others
               receive their treatment preference. This work was motivated by
               the Women Take Pride (WTP) study, a doubly randomized preference
               trial (DRPT) that assessed behavioral interventions for women
               with heart disease. We propose a model for estimating the causal
               effects in the subpopulations defined by treatment preferences,
               and thus preference effects. We describe an EM algorithm for
               computing maximum likelihood estimates of the model parameters.
               We illustrate the method by analyzing sickness impact profile
               (SIP) scores and treatment adherence in the WTP data. Our
               results show some evidence that SIP scores were improved when
               women received their preferred treatment and strong preference
               effects on program adherence; that is, women assigned to their
               preferred treatment were more likely to adhere to the program.
               We also provide a framework for assessing the DRPT and other
               hybrid trial designs and discuss some alternative designs from
               the perspective of the strength of assumptions required to make
               causal inferences. Please see the supplemental material for a

  abstract  = "ABSTRACTMass media are frequently cited as having the potential
               to inform the public, raising knowledge levels and reducing
               political knowledge gaps between citizens. But media are also
               seen as a force for segmentation, disengagement, and widening
               differences between citizens. If media have no effect on
               political knowledge, gaps between the engaged and disengaged
               persist regardless of who is exposed to news because no one
               learns. But gaps can also persist even if everyone learns from
               the news, particularly if learning effects are heterogeneous
               across those inclined and disinclined to seek out news and/or
               across environments that consist of different media
               alternatives. Yet past research on political communication has
               not sufficiently linked media choice to debates about possibly
               heterogeneous effects of media exposure on political knowledge
               levels. The present study contributes a novel and large-scale
               choice-based experiment on knowledge of the ongoing crisis in
               Syria that finds media effects are relatively homogeneous across
               those with different media preferences and across different
               media environments. This suggests that under most conditions ?
               even when everyone learns from the news ? knowledge gaps between
               the politically engaged and disengaged are widened or at least
               sustained after incidental exposure to politics. While closing
               such gaps may be impossible, the results have important
               implications for understanding how citizens learn about politics
               and how to study learning from self-selected media experiences.",

              coverage? Leveraging quasi-random geographic variation in media

               that the potential for movement-led political change is
               significantly rooted in mainstream democratic discourse and
               specifically in the political acceptance of new issuesby news
               media, the general public, and elected officials. This is true
               to some extent for any group wishing to alter status quo
               distributions of rights and/or resources, but is especially
               important for grassroots challengers who do not already have a

               movement experienced over 120 policy victories and the marriage
               equality movement suffered many policydefeats, the overall
               impact that marriage equality had on changing American politics
               was much greater than that of the living wage because of its
               deliberate effort to change mainstream political discourse, and

  abstract  = "Intersectionality theory has been characterized as the most
               significant intellectual contribution of gender studies to the
               world. Surprisingly, at least part of its success has been
               attributed to its vagueness. Nowhere is this more true than in
               the empirical applications of intersectionality. When enacted
               empirically, intersectionality theory is usually conceptualized
               as a theory that fits four standards of empirical social
               research: (1) It explains a phenomenon. (2) It is grounded in a
               substantive literature. (3) It is falsifiable. (4) It is
               methodologically agnostic. Is this, however, the most
               appropriate way to empirically operationalize the legal theory
               of intersectionality? This chapter examines two contrasting
               empirical operationalizations of intersectionality theory and
               suggests a series of trade-offs between them, including
               preservation of theoretical integrity and current litigational
               utility. To do so, the author uses an ongoing research project
               concerning same-sex marriage, or marriage equality as it is
               termed by advocates, to illustrate distinct empirical
               methodologies that are compatible with the

               attention to the simultaneous and interacting effects of gender,

               categories of difference. Intersectional arguments and research

               less-desirable jobs, lower earnings, and higher poverty rates.
               In this essay, we draw attention to the role of the state in
               structuring such inequality. Specifically, we examine how public
               policy is related to racial inequities in economic positions
               among women. Applying an intersectional lens to the contemporary
               landscape of economic inequality, we probe the associations

               policies have unequal consequences across subgroups of women,

               how and where to invest resources have differential implications
               based on women's race and ethnicity. We encourage scholars to

               women of color is vital to achieving gender and racial parity in

               share of the population. In this dialogue, we focus on the
               patterns of opportunities that women of color have used to run
               for state legislative office. Building on other
               intersectionality work within the American context, we take
               gender and race/ethnicity to be interactive and mutually
               constitutive, and thus women of color may face unique challenges
               and opportunities as candidates as compared to non-Hispanic

               color candidates. The findings suggest that while women of color

               Though common-place, this mode of political thinking is not

               African Americans were consistently among the most liberal
               groups in the United States and were much further to the left
               than White Americans on most issues. Starting in the 1980s,
               Black public opinion began to move to the center, and this trend
               has deepened since. Why is this the case? Katherine Tate
               contends that Black political incorporation and increased
               affluence since the civil rights movement have made Black
               politics and public opinion more moderate over time. Black
               leaders now have greater opportunity to participate in
               mainstream politics, and Blacks look to elected officials rather
               than activists for political leadership. Black socioeconomic
               concerns have moved to the center as poverty has declined and
               their economic opportunities have improved. Based on solid
               analysis of public opinion data from the 1970s to the present,
               Tate examines how Black opinions on welfare, affirmative action,

               First, theories of racial priming have not yet been widely
               applied to increasingly common anti-immigrant and anti-Latino
               political appeals. Second, theories of racial priming have not

               appeals, sometimes fails for anti-immigrant appeals, but
               consistently holds for anti-Latino appeals. While we find the

  abstract = "In this paper we revisit a long running question regarding the
              causal antecedents of immigration policy: Is it the immigration
              or the immigrants? Most work on identifies a general dimension -
              ethnocentrism - as the dominant group-based driver of preference
              for restrictions on immigration and benefits to immigrants.
              Material interests, including membership in vulnerable groups and
              perceptions of national and personal economic threats make
              consistent though smaller contributions in previous models. We
              revisit these explanations with nationally representative survey
              data collected at a moment of severe economic upheaval, the days
              immediately prior to the 2008 presidential election. We expected
              material interests might play a larger role in predicting
              immigration opinion than in previous studies. Instead, we found
              ethnocentrism continues to dominate explanations of opinion
              across a wide variety of immigration policies and concerns.
              Finally, we discover that a much more narrow group comparison-
              relative affect for whites over Hispanics - plays the most
              powerful role in these models. We conclude that, at least among
              White Americans, Hispanics and no longer Asians or other groups

               race-conscious policies such as affirmative action. One
               explanation for this is that a new racial belief
               system---referred to as symbolic racism or racial
               resentment---has replaced ``old-fashioned racism.'' Another is
               that nonracial values such as ideology and a preference for
               small government now drive policy opinions. Our theory suggests
               that whereas disgust once accompanied ideas about ``biologically
               inferior'' groups, anger has become fused to conservative ideas
               about race in the contemporary period. As a result, anger now

               operate in ways that promote apathy, cynicism, and quiescence,

               all the trends seem to be in the wrong direction?toward more and

               less. That?s the bad news. The good news is that the messages
               provide a many-voiced, open text that can and often is read
               oppositionally, at least in part. Television imagery is a site
               of struggle where the powers that be are often forced to compete

               the misinformation it can produce among the public. In this
               article, we investigate how the American public interprets
               accurate and inaccurate statements from the news. Moving beyond
               partisanship, we theorize that ideological and ethnoracial
               identities also shape individuals' interpretations of the news.
               We argue that people have incentives to interpret information
               they encounter in ways that favor their ideological and
               ethnoracial ingroups and that these incentives are particularly
               strong when ideological and ethnoracial identities align. Using
               a survey that asks respondents to classify statements from news
               stories as facts or opinions, we find support for these
               hypotheses. Liberals and conservatives, and white, Black, and

               that favor their ingroup's interests while classifying
               information opposing their ingroup's interests as opinions.
               Holding cross-cutting ethnoracial and ideological identities

               stronger ingroup biases in information processing, particularly

               mixed methodological approach in intersectional studies of
               symbolic representation. Existing research concerning symbolic
               representation among traditionally marginalized groups such as
               women, racial and ethnic minorities focuses on the role either
               gender or race/ethnic identity plays in shaping symbolic forms
               of representation such as communication or presentation of self.
               However, extant literature tells us very little about the
               experiences of elected officials who are both women and racial
               and/or ethnic minorities, which are substantively different from

               symbolic representation in the U.S. that uses both quantitative
               and qualitative methods. Through the use of quantitative and

               Woodford argue that despite criticism of Second-Wave feminists

               conjunction with the African American Civil Rights Movement
               proved influential for Black women who came of age during this
               period, launching a generation of female, African American state
               political leaders. Specifically, Brown and colleagues examine
               differences in class and generational cohorts among African
               American female state legislators from 1990 to 2014. They focus
               primarily on African American female state legislators in the
               South since that is where most African Americans live and where
               female African Americans have had the most electoral success. In

               MTurk participants may not buy into interactive experiments and
               that they may produce unreliable or invalid data. We review
               existing research on these topics and present new data to
               address these concerns. We find that insufficient attention is
               no more a problem among MTurk samples than among other commonly
               used convenience or high-quality commercial samples, and that
               MTurk participants buy into interactive experiments and trust
               researchers as much as participants in laboratory studies.
               Furthermore, we find that employing rigorous exclusion methods
               consistently boosts statistical power without introducing
               problematic side effects (e.g., substantially biasing the
               post-exclusion sample), and can thus provide a general solution
               for dealing with problematic respondents across samples. We
               conclude with a discussion of best practices and

               information they receive, the attitudes they form, and the
               interactions they experience. Homophily in race and ethnicity

  abstract = "This article examines the role of party activists in the partisan
              evolution of the abortion issue. Previous research indicates that
              party elites---specifically members of Congress---and partisans
              in the mass public have become more differentiated in their
              abortion attitudes during the last several decades with Democrats
              becoming more pro-choice and Republicans becoming increasingly
              pro-life. The missing piece of the picture is the behavior of
              party activists. Accordingly, this research examines the changes
              in the abortion attitudes of two groups of party activists during
              the last three decades: campaign activists and national
              convention delegates. From 1972 to 1980 there were no significant
              differences in the abortion attitudes of Republican and
              Democratic campaign activists, and the mean positions of the two
              parties' national convention delegates did not differ greatly.
              However, since 1984 there has been a growing differentiation in
              the abortion positions of both groups of party activists. Now
              Democratic activists are consistently pro-choice while Republican
              activists are equally pro-life. This evidence indicates that the
              differentiation on the abortion issue that has only recently
              emerged among partisans in the mass public was predated by an
              earlier and much more dramatic polarization that had already
              developed among party activists and elites, thus supporting a
              model of issue evolution introduced by Carmines and Stimson in
              their study of racial issues. We also find that citizens'
              abortion attitudes have become increasingly correlated with party
              voting not just in presidential elections but also in House,
              Senate, and gubernatorial contests during this period as well as
              being more closely related to political ideology. All of this
              evidence points to the growing extent to which abortion has
              become a partisan issue in American politics and the key role
              that party activists have played in this process.",

              heated political debate and adversarial social movement activity;
              however, national polls have shown little change in aggregate
              levels of support for abortion. This analysis examines how the
              determinants of abortion attitudes have changed between 1977 and
              1996, using data from the General Social Surveys. While in early
              time periods, whites were more approving of abortion than blacks,
              that pattern had reversed by the late 1980s. After controlling
              for other factors, older people are more accepting of abortion
              throughout the two decades, while gender is generally unrelated
              to abortion views. Catholic religion weakens slightly as a
              predictor of abortion attitudes, while religious fundamentalism
              and political liberalism increase in explanatory power. The
              associations between attitudinal correlates and abortion approval
              also change over this time period. Religiosity becomes a less
              powerful predictor of abortion attitudes, while respondents'
              attitude toward sexual freedom and belief in the sanctity of
              human life increase in their predictive power. Support for gender
              inequality remains a weak but stable predictor of abortion
              attitudes. This pattern of results suggests that the public is

               follows a predictable pattern, as outlined by Carmines and
               Stimson. By applying the theory of issue evolution to abortion,
               I develop three hypotheses: 1) The reputation for each party's
               stance on abortion among party elites has grown clearer and more
               distinct over the last 20 years; 2) At the mass level, people
               have changed their party identification in a manner consistent
               with their attitudes on abortion; 3) The changes among party
               elites and masses are causally connected, with elite-level
               changes producing mass-level responses. Simple time series

  abstract = "CONTEXT: Entertainment television can impact viewers' knowledge,
              attitudes, and reproductive health behaviors, yet little research
              has examined the impact of scripted abortion plotlines on
              viewers' abortion knowledge or social supportiveness for those
              having abortions. We examined the impact of an abortion storyline
              from Grey's Anatomy on US-based viewers. METHOD: We conducted an
              online survey of likely Grey's Anatomy viewers prior to the
              episode's airing, assessing abortion ideology, knowledge, and
              support. After airing, we resurveyed respondents (including both
              those who had and had not viewed the target episode). We tested
              three hypotheses: episode exposure would (1) improve abortion
              knowledge and (2) increase support for medication abortion and
              decrease support for self-induced abortion, and (3) the effects
              on knowledge and supportive intention would be moderated by state
              support for abortion. We used independent samples t tests to
              examine hypotheses 1 and 2 and PROCESS macro to test the
              moderated effects (hypothesis 3). RESULTS: The results of the
              pretest/posttest analysis indicated that exposure to the episode
              significantly improved medication abortion knowledge. Increases
              in medication abortion knowledge were tied to explicit
              educational dialogue and did not translate into an increase in
              general abortion knowledge or social supportiveness. Notably,
              abortion-related state policy significantly moderated the
              influence of exposure for respondents in states with policies
              favorable to abortion access. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest
              that entertainment television can contribute to meaningful
              increases in viewers' knowledge about abortion, but that the
              potential for impact of entertainment-education is closely linked
              to episode content and moderated by state-level abortion policy.",

  abstract  = "This paper examines the ways that social movement organizations
               affiliated with the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement use
               Twitter through three content analysis studies. The main finding
               presented in the paper is that the modal tweet generated between
               December 1, 2015 and October 31, 2016 was an emotional
               response---an expression of sadness, outrage, or despair---to
               police brutality and the killings of African Americans. The
               second key finding is that BLM organizations generated more
               tweets that framed the movement as a struggle for individual
               rights than ones that utilized frames about gender, racial, and
               LGBTQ identities. Finally, the paper shows that BLM activists

               contention less frequently than they encourage other political
               behaviors. These findings suggest that the BLM movement is

               affect agreement by enhancing issue-relevant thinking when
               personal involvement was high. In addition to manipulating the
               personal relevance of the communication topic, both the number
               and the quality of the arguments in the message were varied. In
               a pilot study with 46 undergraduates, when the issue was of low
               relevance, Ss showed more agreement in response to a message
               containing 6 arguments (3 strong and 3 weak) than to messages
               containing either 3 strong or 3 weak arguments. Under high
               involvement, however, the 6-argument message did not increase
               agreement over the message containing only 3 strong arguments.
               In the full experiment, 168 undergraduates received either 3 or
               9 arguments that were either all cogent or all specious under
               conditions of either high or low involvement. The manipulation

               perspective-getting narratives durably reduce exclusionary

               reduces exclusionary attitudes and activates multiple

               deliberative theory, which sees deliberation as occurring across
               a range of differentiated but interconnected spaces, it suggests
               that narrative is a crucial device by which people talk and
               think about complex and contested issues. It argues that
               deliberative democrats must come to terms with narrative because
               its pervasive influence can affect deliberative systems in
               important ways. The article outlines these potential impacts ?
               both those that reinforce deliberative ideals and those that
               conflict with them. It concludes by looking at the broader
               implications for the practice, theory and study of deliberative

               more persuasive than messages with high levels of credibility

               motivated to persuade themselves to change their own attitudes

               produce more powerful and more long-lasting effects than do
               direct techniques of persuasion. This is primarily due to the
               fact that in direct persuasion, members of an audience are
               constantly aware of the fact that someone is trying (or has
               tried) to influence them. In a self-persuasion situation, people

               of the most high-profile events of political violence in recent

               Contrary to some expectations from the academic literature and

               increased mobilization of both African American and white

               and public opinion on civil rights. Counties proximate to
               nonviolent protests saw presidential Democratic vote share

               concern toward ``social control.'' In 1968, using rainfall as an

               fraternity reunion, rated their transportation into the story,
               rated the perceived realism of the story, and responded to

               members, were knowledgeable about American fraternities) showed

               readers showed more story-consistent beliefs, and the positive

               sciences and Humanities to solve a number of mysteries: Most of
               us will have had those moments, of being totally absorbed in a
               book, a movie, or computer game. Typically we do not have any
               idea about how we ended up in such a state. Nor do we fully
               realize how we might have changed as we return for the fictional
               worlds we have visited. The feeling of being absorbed is one of
               the most illusive and transient feelings, but also one that
               motivates audiences to spend considerable amounts of time in
               narrative worlds, and one that is central to our understanding
               of the effects of narratives on beliefs and behavior. Key

               the peculiar state of consciousness during episodes of
               absorption, the perception of absorption in history, the role of

               What is explanation? and What is narrative explanation? In
               answering these questions, we develop a framework of narrative
               elements and characteristics of narrative explanations. Two
               possible examples of narrative explanation are presented and
               examined in light of the framework. This examination brings to
               light various conceptual and empirical questions related to the
               examples and to the larger issue of the use of examples like
               them in science instruction. The value of the framework lies
               partly in its power to point to such questions. The questions

               mechanisms that participate in prose comprehension are far from
               obvious. Even simple stories involve com plexities that have
               stymied many cognitive scientists. Why is prose comprehen sion
               so difficult to study? Perhaps because comprehension is guided
               by so many domains of knowledge. Perhaps because some critical
               mysteries of prose comprehension reside between the lines-in the
               mind of the comprehender. Ten years ago very few psychologists
               were willing to dig beyond the surface of explicit code in their
               studies of discourse processing. Tacit knowledge, world
               knowledge, inferences, and expectations were slippery notions

               governed by the physical stimulus. Fortunately, times have
               changed. Cognitive scientists are now vigorously exploring the
               puzzles of comprehension that lie beyond the word. The study of
               discourse processing is currently growing at a frenetic pace.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: In recent years, in an attempt to counter stigma and
              increase empathy, public education campaigns have encouraged
              people to share their personal abortion stories. This exploratory
              study sought to document negative and positive experiences of
              those who have shared their abortion stories publicly. STUDY
              DESIGN: We conducted an anonymous online survey of people who
              have shared their abortion story publicly (N = 88), recruited via
              partners affiliated with two abortion story-sharing campaigns.
              The survey asked about the context in which respondents shared
              their abortion story, any negative and positive experiences
              online and in ``real life'' as a result of story sharing, and any
              problems or benefits resulting from these experiences. We
              analyzed survey data using descriptive statistics, bivariate
              analyses and categorizing responses to open-ended questions.
              RESULTS: Sixty percent of respondents reported experiencing
              harassment and other negative incidents after sharing their story
              publicly. These experiences contributed to emotional stress,
              problems with loved ones and difficulties at work and/or school.
              These harms were reported even by many respondents who used only
              a first name or alias when sharing their story. Despite this,
              positive experiences as a result of story sharing were reported
              by four out of five respondents and motivated many to continue
              sharing their story. CONCLUSIONS: This exploratory study
              indicates that many people who share their abortion story
              publicly find it to be an empowering, rewarding experience. Yet
              they also experience harassment and threats at high rates. Future
              research should explore both positive and negative experiences in
              more depth. IMPLICATIONS: Sharing one's personal abortion story
              as part of a public education campaign can be a positive,
              empowering experience. Nevertheless, policymakers, journalists
              and reproductive health advocates should recognize the potential
              harms experienced by people who share their abortion story
              publicly and consider measures to support these individuals.",

               production of abortion stigma is profoundly local. Abortion
               stigma is neither natural nor 'essential' and relies upon power

               emergence, perpetuation and normalisation of abortion stigma. We
               hypothesise that abortion transgresses three cherished
               'feminine' ideals: perpetual fecundity; the inevitability of
               motherhood; and instinctive nurturing. We offer examples of how

               to argue with, and what brings them back to repeated exchanges?
               In short, why do people bother arguing online? We develop a
               model of argument engagement using a new dataset of Twitter
               conversations about President Trump. The model incorporates
               numerous user, tweet, and thread-level features to predict user
               participation in conversations with over 98\% accuracy. We find
               that users are likely to argue over wide ideological divides,
               and are increasingly likely to engage with those who are
               different from themselves. In addition, we find that the
               emotional content of a tweet has important implications for user
               engagement, with negative and unpleasant tweets more likely to
               spark sustained participation. Although often negative, these
               extended discussions can bridge political differences and reduce
               information bubbles. This suggests a public appetite for
               engaging in prolonged political discussions that are more than
               just partisan potshots or trolling, and our results suggest a
               variety of strategies for extending and enriching these
               interactions.",

               social scientists have invented and revised ways to measure what

               old-fashioned anti-black affect is a thing of the past. We

               attitudinal measures to simultaneously estimate the relationship
               between cognitive beliefs about the racial status quo and

              Mechanical Turk, but their takeaways---the claims that it is
              ``too good to be true,'' and that it captured ``only 14 human
              beings … [of] N=529''---are radically misleading, yet have been

              inference with observational studies. Sensitivity analysis
              provides an attractive way to partially circumvent this issue by
              assessing the potential influence of unmeasured confounding on
              causal conclusions. However, previous sensitivity analysis
              approaches often make strong and untestable assumptions such as
              having an unmeasured confounder that is binary, or having no
              interaction between the effects of the exposure and the
              confounder on the outcome, or having only one unmeasured
              confounder. Without imposing any assumptions on the unmeasured
              confounder or confounders, we derive a bounding factor and a
              sharp inequality such that the sensitivity analysis parameters
              must satisfy the inequality if an unmeasured confounder is to
              explain away the observed effect estimate or reduce it to a
              particular level. Our approach is easy to implement and involves
              only two sensitivity parameters. Surprisingly, our bounding
              factor, which makes no simplifying assumptions, is no more
              conservative than a number of previous sensitivity analysis
              techniques that do make assumptions. Our new bounding factor
              implies not only the traditional Cornfield conditions that both
              the relative risk of the exposure on the confounder and that of
              the confounder on the outcome must satisfy but also a high
              threshold that the maximum of these relative risks must satisfy.
              Furthermore, this new bounding factor can be viewed as a measure
              of the strength of confounding between the exposure and the

  abstract  = "Outcome tests are a popular method for detecting bias in
               lending, hiring, and policing decisions. These tests operate by
               comparing the success rate of decisions across groups. For
               example, if loans made to minority applicants are observed to be
               repaid more often than loans made to whites, it suggests that
               only exceptionally qualified minorities are granted loans,
               indicating discrimination. Outcome tests, however, are known to
               suffer from the problem of infra-marginality: even absent
               discrimination, the repayment rates for minority and white loan
               recipients might differ if the two groups have different risk
               distributions. Thus, at least in theory, outcome tests can fail
               to accurately detect discrimination. We develop a new
               statistical test of discrimination---the threshold test---that
               mitigates the problem of infra-marginality by jointly estimating
               decision thresholds and risk distributions. Applying our test to
               a dataset of 4.5 million police stops in North Carolina, we find
               that the problem of infra-marginality is more than a theoretical
               possibility, and can cause the outcome test to yield misleading
               results in practice.",

              observational studies that are potentially subject to
              confounding. The E-value is defined as the minimum strength of
              association, on the risk ratio scale, that an unmeasured

              association, conditional on the measured covariates. A large
              E-value implies that considerable unmeasured confounding would be

              implies little unmeasured confounding would be needed to explain

               novel sensitivity measures suited for routine reporting. The

               police stress and domestic violence in police families were
               used. Using multivariate regression analysis, the authors focus

               employment, with proxies for social and workplace
               factors.Findings-- Higher levels of cooperation (trust),
               interactional justice and work‐life‐balance reduce police
               officers' intentions to quit. While high levels of physical and
               psychological strain and trauma are not correlated with
               intentions to quit.Research limitations/implications-- A
               discernible limitation of this study is the age of the data
               analyzed and that many changes have occurred in recent times
               (policing and social). It would be of great interest to repeat
               this study to gauge the true effect.Practical implications--
               There are policy implications for retention and recruitment: it
               may possible to decrease the ethnic and gender gaps, through
               identifying officers at risk and creating programs to hold

               for police officers. It is demonstrated that social capital,
               fairness and work‐life balance are moderators for quitting,

               result from respondents insincerely reporting politically
               congenial views in order to gain expressive psychological
               benefits. Importantly, these findings have been interpreted as

               beliefs in the real world. We synthesize evidence and commentary
               on this matter, drawing two conclusions: (1) evidence for
               insincere expressive responding on divisive political matters is
               limited and ambiguous and (2) when experimental manipulations in

               that they may produce unreliable or invalid data. We review

               no more a problem among MTurk samples than among other commonly
               used convenience or high-quality commercial samples, and that
               MTurk participants buy into interactive experiments and trust
               researchers as much as participants in laboratory studies.

              actors have placed them in the public sphere. In this paper, we
              examine the feedback effects of these publicized incidents. Using
              a unique survey-experiment implemented in 2019, we demonstrate
              that controversial police use of force against minority civilians
              prompts strong emotional reactions, increases support for
              body-cameras, changes beliefs about excessive force, and alters
              attitudes toward law enforcement. Notably, our design allows us
              to examine the effects of both text-based news stories and videos
              pulled from two real-world use of force cases, one lethal and one
              non-lethal. This study has important implications for public
              opinion, feedback effects, and perceptions of law enforcement.",

  abstract  = "Dropping subjects based on the results of a manipulation check
               following treatment assignment is common practice across the
               social sciences, presumably to restrict estimates to a
               subpopulation of subjects who understand the experimental
               prompt. We show that this practice can lead to serious bias and
               argue for a focus on what is revealed without discarding
               subjects. Generalizing results developed in Zhang and Rubin
               (2003) and Lee (2009) to the case of multiple treatments, we
               provide sharp bounds for potential outcomes among those who
               would pass a manipulation check regardless of treatment
               assignment. These bounds may have large or infinite width,
               implying that this inferential target is often out of reach. As
               an application, we replicate Press, Sagan, and Valentino (2013)
               with a design that does not drop subjects that failed the
               manipulation check and show that the findings are likely
               stronger than originally reported. We conclude with suggestions
               for practice, namely alterations to the experimental design.",

  abstract  = "Persuasion is a vital part of politics?who wins elections and
               policy disputes often depends on which side can persuade more
               people. Given this centrality, the study of persuasion has a
               long history with an enormous number of theories and empirical
               inquiries. However, the literature is fragmented, with few
               generalizable findings. I unify previously disparate dimensions
               of this topic by presenting a framework focusing on actors
               (speakers and receivers), treatments (topics, content, media),
               outcomes (attitudes, behaviors, emotions, identities), and
               settings (competition, space, time, process, culture). This
               Generalizing Persuasion (GP) Framework organizes distinct
               findings and offers researchers a structure in which to situate
               their work. I conclude with a discussion of the normative

              than facts}",
  author   = "Kubin, Emily and Puryear, Curtis and Schein, Chelsea and Gray,
              Kurt",
  abstract = "Both liberals and conservatives believe that using facts in
              political discussions helps to foster mutual respect, but 15
              studies-across multiple methodologies and issues-show that these
              beliefs are mistaken. Political opponents respect moral beliefs
              more when they are supported by personal experiences, not facts.
              The respect-inducing power of personal experiences is revealed by
              survey studies across various political topics, a field study of
              conversations about guns, an analysis of YouTube comments from
              abortion opinion videos, and an archival analysis of 137
              interview transcripts from Fox News and CNN. The personal
              experiences most likely to encourage respect from opponents are
              issue-relevant and involve harm. Mediation analyses reveal that
              these harm-related personal experiences increase respect by
              increasing perceptions of rationality: everyone can appreciate
              that avoiding harm is rational, even in people who hold different
              beliefs about guns, taxes, immigration, and the environment.
              Studies show that people believe in the truth of both facts and
              personal experiences in nonmoral disagreement; however, in moral
              disagreements, subjective experiences seem truer (i.e., are
              doubted less) than objective facts. These results provide a
              concrete demonstration of how to bridge moral divides while also
              revealing how our intuitions can lead us astray. Stretching back
              to the Enlightenment, philosophers and scientists have privileged
              objective facts over experiences in the pursuit of truth.
              However, furnishing perceptions of truth within moral
              disagreements is better accomplished by sharing subjective
              experiences, not by providing facts.",
