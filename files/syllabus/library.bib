abstract = {Data science has attracted a lot of attention, promising to turn vast amounts of data into useful predictions and insights. In this article, we ask why scientists should care about data science. To answer, we discuss data science from three perspectives: statistical, computational, and human. Although each of the three is a critical component of data science, we argue that the effective combination of all three components is the essence of what data science is about. data science | statistics | machine learning The term " data science " has attracted a lot of attention. Much of this attention is in business (1), in government (2), and in the academic areas of statistics (3, 4) and computer science (5, 6). Here, we discuss data science from the perspective of scientific research. What is data science? Why might scientists care about it? Our perspective is that data science is the child of statistics and computer science. While it has inherited some of their methods and thinking, it also seeks to blend them, refocus them, and develop them to address the context and needs of modern scientific data analysis. This perspective is not new. Over 50 years ago, Tukey (7) defined " data analysis " as a broad endeavor, much broader than traditional math-ematical statistics. In a sense, today's data science, although set against a modern backdrop, is cast from Tukey's original mold. In modern research, scientists from diverse disci-plines are confronting abundant datasets and are confident that there is value in the data for advancing their scientific goals. We give three examples at genomic, social, and galactic scales. First, modern sequencing technology has enabled high-resolution genetic sequencing at massive scale, and geneticists have connected the genetic data to large databases of individuals' behaviors and diseases. These data can potentially aid researchers in studying the human ge-nome, helping them understand how it evolves, and how it governs observed traits. Second, social scien-tists now have the opportunity to study large archives of digitized texts, often with rich information about human behavior and interactions. These data could help them more effectively navigate and understand the contours of society, finding relevant sources to their work and identifying hard to spot patterns of language that suggest new interpretations and theo-ries. Third, modern telescopes create digital sky sur-veys that have transformed observational astronomy, generating hundreds of terabytes of raw image data about billions of sky objects. A catalog of these ob-jects, if available, would give astronomers an unprec-edented window into the structure of the cosmos. These examples paint a picture of what might be possible in the modern sciences. However, an issue that pervades many, if not all, scientific disciplines is that scientists cannot yet fully take advantage of their new data. Connecting genes and traits at large scale is a problem that is beyond the limits of classical genome analysis, both computationally and statisti-cally. Building tools for navigating large collections of documents, especially ones that reflect the priorities of social scientists, is a problem that is not solved by classical methods of document analysis. Using digital sky surveys to understand the complex nature of the universe requires computational tools and statistical assumptions beyond those used for the manually curated studies of earlier eras. Broadly speaking, there is a tension emerging— the existing methods from statistics and computing are not set up to solve the types of problems that face modern scientists. Some issues are computational, such as working with massive datasets and complex metadata. Some issues are statistical, such as the rich interactions of many related variables and the},

Despite this enthusiasm, however, there has been no research on law enforcement command staff perceptions of BWCs. Given the importance that law enforcement leadership plays in the decision to adopt and implement BWCs, it is necessary to assess their perceptions. This is the first study to measure law enforcement leadership attitudes toward BWCs. The study relies on data collected from surveys administered to command staff representing local, state and federal law enforcement agencies in a large southern county. Among the major perceptual findings are that command staff believe BWCs will impact police officers' decisions to use force in encounters with citizens and police will be more reluctant to use necessary force in encounters with the public. Respondents also believe that use of BWCs is supported by the public because society does not trust police, media will use BWC data to embarrass police, and pressure to implement BWCs comes from the media. Perceptions of the impact of BWCs on safety, privacy, and police effectiveness are also discussed.},

A quantitative content analysis of the most popular YouTube political news videos during the 2008 US presidential election was conducted to investigate the degree to which nonelites were able to partake in mainstream public discourse. We found that elites dominated first and second filters (news sourcing and news production) in the flow of online news, while nonelites dominated the third filter (news distribution). These results suggest that an update to the traditional gatekeeping model is needed to reflect the realities of today's user-driven communication environment.},

@book{Bretz2011,
abstract = {Adopting a unifying theme based on maximum statistics, Multiple Comparisons Using R describes the common underlying theory of multiple comparison procedures through numerous examples. It also presents a detailed description of available software implementations in R. The R packages and source code for the analyses are available at http://CRAN.R-project.org After giving examples of multiplicity problems, the book covers general concepts and basic multiple comparisons procedures, including the Bonferroni method and Simes' test. It then shows how to perform parametric multiple comparisons in standard linear models and general parametric models. It also introduces the multcomp package in R, which offers a convenient interface to perform multiple comparisons in a general context. Following this theoretical framework, the book explores applications involving the Dunnett test, Tukey's all pairwise comparisons, and general multiple contrast tests for standard regression models, mixed-effects models, and parametric survival models. The last chapter reviews other multiple comparison procedures, such as resampling-based procedures, methods for group sequential or adaptive designs, and the combination of multiple comparison procedures with modeling techniques. Controlling multiplicity in experiments ensures better decision making and safeguards against false claims. A self-contained introduction to multiple comparison procedures, this book offers strategies for constructing the procedures and illustrates the framework for multiple hypotheses testing in general parametric models. It is suitable for readers with R experience but limited knowledge of multiple comparison procedures and vice versa. See Dr. Bretz discuss the book.},

abstract = {Police Body-Worn Cameras breaks down what's known – and not known – about the promises, perils, and potential best practices around police body-worn cameras. Both law enforcement and civil rights advocates are excited by the potential of body-worn cameras to improve community policing and safety, but there is no empirical research to conclusively suggest that these will reduce the deaths of black male civilians in encounters with police. There are some documented milder benefits evident from small pilot studies, such as more polite interactions between police and civilians when both parties are aware they are being recorded, and decreased fraudulent complaints made against officers. Many uncertainties about best practices of body-worn camera adoption and use remain, including when the cameras should record, what should be stored and retained, who should have access to the footage, and what policies should determine the release of footage to the public. As pilot and permanent body-worn camera programs are implemented, it is important to ask questions about how they can be best used to achieve their touted goals. How will the implementation of these programs be assessed for their efficacy in achieving accountability goals? What are the best policies to have in place to support those goals?},

The samples selected have been taken from citizens eligible as jurors according to Spanish law. Real cases of manslaughter have been used. The results obtained show that the type of sample, the presentation format and the strength of evidence have an independent effect on the jurors? decisions. The strongest influence on verdict is attributable, first, to the evidence; secondly, to the type of sample; and, finally, to the presentation format. The effects caused by the studied variables on the jurors? verdict tendency also seem to recur in some of the relevant questions which make them explain and justify their verdicts, the effect being more noticeable with ambiguous evidence.

abstract = {Today, the ubiquity of cameraphones and online social media's contributions to sociopolitical discourses on policing have exponentially increased the public's exposure to police mis/conduct. This article reports on research that inquired into the influence of ‘policing's new visibility' on front-line officers. Participants in the project included 231 operational police officers and institutional policing officials in Toronto and Ottawa (Canada). The study found that videorecording capabilities across the citizenry and concurrent opportunities for the public to disseminate footage of police occurrences (and conduct) through online file-sharing are profoundly integrated into the consciousness of most rank-and-file officers and have influenced significant behavioural changes through the deterrence of certain practices, including moderations in police violence across a majority of study participants.},

@article{Pearl2009,
abstract = {This reviewpresents empirical researcherswith recent advances in causal inference, and stresses the paradigmatic shifts that must be un- dertaken in moving fromtraditional statistical analysis to causal analysis of multivariate data. Special emphasis is placed on the assumptions that un- derly all causal inferences, the languages used in formulating those assump- tions, the conditional nature of all causal and counterfactual claims, and the methods that have been developed for the assessment of such claims. These advances are illustrated using a general theory of causation based on the Structural Causal Model (SCM) described in Pearl (2000a), which subsumes and unifies other approaches to causation, and provides a coher- entmathematical foundation for the analysis of causes and counterfactuals. In particular, the paper surveys the development of mathematical tools for inferring (from a combination of data and assumptions) answers to three types of causal queries: (1) queries about the effects of potential interven- tions, (also called “causal effects” or “policy evaluation”) (2) queries about probabilities of counterfactuals, (including assessment of “regret,” “attri- bution” or “causes of effects”) and (3) queries about direct and indirect effects (also known as “mediation”). Finally, the paper defines the formal and conceptual relationships between the structural and potential-outcome frameworks and presents tools for a symbiotic analysis that uses the strong features of both.},

@article{Ariel2016,
abstract = {Police use of force is at the forefront of public awareness in many countries. Body-worn videos (BWVs) have been proposed as a new way of reducing police use of force, as well as assaults against officers. To date, only a handful of peer-reviewed randomised trials have looked at the effectiveness of BWVs, primarily focusing on use of force and complaints. We sought to replicate these studies, adding assaults against police officers as an additional outcome. Using a prospective meta-analysis of multi-site, multi-national randomised controlled trials from 10 discrete tests with a total population of +2 million, and 2.2 million police officer-hours, we assess the effect of BWVs on the rates of (i) police use of force and (ii) assaults against officers. Averaged over 10 trials, BWVs had no effect on police use of force (d = 0.021; SE = 0.056; 95{\%} CI: –0.089–0.130), but led to an increased rate of assaults against officers wearing cameras (d = 0.176; SE = 0.058; 95{\%} CI: 0.061–0.290). As there is evidence that cameras may increase the risk of assaults against officers, more attention should be paid to how these devices are implemented. Likewise, since other public-facing organisations are considering equipping their staff with BWVs (e.g. firefighters, private security, traffic wardens), the findings on risks associated with BWVs are transferrable to those occupations as well.},

It cites the lack of clear policies on data sharing in police departments around the U.S.},

abstract = {People within organized groups often internalize their feelings of obligation to obey group rules and the decisions of group authorities. They believe that group authorities and rules are legitimate and, hence, entitled to be obeyed. Because of this belief, group members voluntarily accept and obey rules and decisions from group authorities. This review draws on evidence from studies of authorities in political, legal, managerial, educational, and family settings to explore why people view as legitimate and voluntarily defer to group authorities. Two theories about legitimacy are contrasted: resource-based theories, represented by instrumental models, and identification based theories, represented by the relational model. The findings provide strong support for the existence of a relational component of legitimacy, suggesting that authorities draw an important part of their legitimacy from their social relationship with group members. The findings also show that there is an instrumental component to legit...},

abstract = {"The diffusion and rapid evolution of new communication technologies has completely reshaped media and politics. But who are the new power players? Written by a leading scholar in the field, The Hybrid Media System is a sweeping and compelling new theory of how political communication now works. The new media system is increasingly defined by organizations, groups, and individuals who are best able to blend old and new within what Andrew Chadwick terms a hybrid system. Those who are best able to create, tap, and steer information to suit their goals are, in turn, able to modify, enable, and disable the power of others between a range of older and newer media. Chadwick looks at news making in all of its contemporary "professional" and "amateur" forms, from parties and election campaigns, to activist movements, and government communication. He weaves in compelling ethnographic material from American presidential campaigns to WikiLeaks, and from live prime ministerial debates to hotly-contested political scandals. The end result of this wide-ranging book is a map of the emerging balance of power between older and newer media technologies, genres, norms, behaviors, and organizational forms. Chadwick argues that hybrid thinking rejects simple dichotomies, and he reveals how older and newer media logics in the fields of media and politics blend, overlap, intermesh, and coevolve. Political communication has entered a new era. This book reveals how the clash of older and newer media logics is causing chaos and disintegration but also surprising new patterns of order and integration"-- "The diffusion and rapid evolution of new communication technologies has created a pressing need to understand the complex forces reshaping media and politics. Who is emerging as powerful in this new context? Written by a leading scholar in the field, this book provides a new, holistic interpretation of how political communication now works. In The Hybrid Media System Andrew Chadwick reveals how political communication is increasingly shaped by interactions among older and newer media logics. Organizations, groups, and individuals in this system are linked by complex and ever-evolving relationships based on adaptation and interdependence. Chadwick shows how power is exercised by those who create, tap, and steer information flows to suit their goals, and in ways that modify, enable, and disable the agency of others across and between a range of older and newer media settings. The book examines a range of examples of this systemic hybridity in flow in concrete political communication contexts ranging from news making in all of its contemporary "professional" and "amateur" forms, to parties and election campaigns, to activist movements, and government communication. Compelling stories bring the theory to life. From American presidential campaigns to WikiLeaks, from live prime ministerial debates to hotly-contested political scandals that evolve in real time, from historical precedents stretching back five hundred years to the author's unique ethnographic data gathered from recent insider fieldwork among journalists, campaign workers, bloggers, and activist organizations, this wide-ranging book maps the emerging balance of power between older and newer media technologies, genres, norms, behaviors, and organizational forms"-- Introduction -- 1.

@book{Chadwick2017,
abstract = {"The diffusion and rapid evolution of new communication technologies has completely reshaped media and politics. But who are the new power players? Written by a leading scholar in the field, The Hybrid Media System is a sweeping and compelling new theory of how political communication now works. The new media system is increasingly defined by organizations, groups, and individuals who are best able to blend old and new within what Andrew Chadwick terms a hybrid system. Those who are best able to create, tap, and steer information to suit their goals are, in turn, able to modify, enable, and disable the power of others between a range of older and newer media. Chadwick looks at news making in all of its contemporary "professional" and "amateur" forms, from parties and election campaigns, to activist movements, and government communication. He weaves in compelling ethnographic material from American presidential campaigns to WikiLeaks, and from live prime ministerial debates to hotly-contested political scandals. The end result of this wide-ranging book is a map of the emerging balance of power between older and newer media technologies, genres, norms, behaviors, and organizational forms. Chadwick argues that hybrid thinking rejects simple dichotomies, and he reveals how older and newer media logics in the fields of media and politics blend, overlap, intermesh, and coevolve. Political communication has entered a new era. This book reveals how the clash of older and newer media logics is causing chaos and disintegration but also surprising new patterns of order and integration"-- "The diffusion and rapid evolution of new communication technologies has created a pressing need to understand the complex forces reshaping media and politics. Who is emerging as powerful in this new context? Written by a leading scholar in the field, this book provides a new, holistic interpretation of how political communication now works. In The Hybrid Media System Andrew Chadwick reveals how political communication is increasingly shaped by interactions among older and newer media logics. Organizations, groups, and individuals in this system are linked by complex and ever-evolving relationships based on adaptation and interdependence. Chadwick shows how power is exercised by those who create, tap, and steer information flows to suit their goals, and in ways that modify, enable, and disable the agency of others across and between a range of older and newer media settings. The book examines a range of examples of this systemic hybridity in flow in concrete political communication contexts ranging from news making in all of its contemporary "professional" and "amateur" forms, to parties and election campaigns, to activist movements, and government communication. Compelling stories bring the theory to life. From American presidential campaigns to WikiLeaks, from live prime ministerial debates to hotly-contested political scandals that evolve in real time, from historical precedents stretching back five hundred years to the author's unique ethnographic data gathered from recent insider fieldwork among journalists, campaign workers, bloggers, and activist organizations, this wide-ranging book maps the emerging balance of power between older and newer media technologies, genres, norms, behaviors, and organizational forms"-- Introduction -- 1.

abstract = {In 2015, the so-called “Rialto study” was published in a peer-reviewed journal, although the findings of this experiment impacted policing as early as 2013. The yearlong study of officers who wore Body Worn Cameras (BWCs) in Rialto, California found that among those officers who wore the devices, use of force incidents decreased, as did complaints against the officers. These findings were extensively profiled in news media and lauded by numerous police agencies across North America and the United Kingdom. This article examines reporting of the findings of the Rialto study in news media. BWCs have received considerably more coverage in news media than in the research literature. Practically no scholarship has addressed this issue. BWCs are said to enhance police legitimacy, or the judgements of citizens concerning police conduct. A great deal of police legitimacy concerns maintaining control over their public image in media as the legitimate authority, or image work. Given the importance of police image wo...},

This textbook is a practical introduction to data analysis and statistics written especially for undergraduates and beginning graduate students in the social sciences and allied fields, such as economics, sociology, public policy, and data science. Quantitative Social Science engages directly with empirical analysis, showing students how to analyze data using the R programming language and to interpret the results—it encourages hands-on learning, not paper-and-pencil statistics. More than forty data sets taken directly from leading quantitative social science research illustrate how data analysis can be used to answer important questions about society and human behavior. Proven in the classroom, this one-of-a-kind textbook features numerous additional data analysis exercises and interactive R programming exercises, and also comes with supplementary teaching materials for instructors.},

We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. For more information about JSTOR, please contact support@jstor.org. SUMMARY The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses -the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. There-fore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

These groups use digital media technologies to challenge official accounts of events and encroach on the borders of traditional journalism. This qualitative project collected material over the course of 2 years, and uses participant observation and long-form interviews to explore the nature of this activism. Grounded analysis suggests that cop-watching represents a unique form of citizenship; one that combines text and practice to produce embodied narratives, which can give voice to the concerns of others. As a form of so-called sousveillance, cop-watching extends and complicates existing theories about surveillance, journalism, and visual evidence.},

abstract = {We conducted two studies, wherein participants from across the United States watched, heard, or read the transcript of an actual police shooting event. The data for Study 1 were collected prior to media coverage of a widely publicized police shooting in Ferguson, Missouri. Results indicated that participants who could hear or see the event were significantly more likely to perceive the shooting was justified than they were when they read a transcript of the encounter. Shortly after the events in Ferguson, Missouri, we replicated the first study, finding quite different results. Although dissatisfaction with the shooting was seen in all forms of presentation, video evidence producted the highest citizen perceptions of an unjustified shooting and audio evidence produced the least. Citizens were nonetheless overwhelmingly favorable to requiring police to use body cameras. Body-mounted cameras with high quality audio capabilities are recommended for police departments to consider.},

abstract = {A huge amount of effort is spent cleaning data to get it ready for analysis, but there has been little research on how to make data cleaning as easy and effective as possible. This paper tackles a small, but important, component of data cleaning: data tidying. Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualise, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This structure also makes it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that both input and output tidy datasets. The advantages of a consistent data structure and matching tools are demonstrated with a case study free from mundane data manipulation chores.},
