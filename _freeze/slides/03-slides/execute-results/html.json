value of heights in POLS 1600 ($\\theta =E[X]$)\n\n-   [Estimator]{.blue} a rule or method for calculating an [estimate]{.blue} of our [estimand]{.blue}\n\n    -   An average of a sample of 10 student's heights in POLS 1600\n    -   $\\hat{\\theta} = \\bar{x} = 1/n*\\sum_1^{n} x_i$\n\n-   [Estimate:]{.blue} a value produced by our estimator for some data\n\n    -   The average of our 10 person sample is `5'10''`\n\n## Error and Bias {.smaller}\n\nWe'll talk about lots of types of bias throughout this course.\n\nFormally, we'll say an estimate, $\\hat{\\theta}$ (\"theta hat\") is an unbiased estimator of a parameter, $\\theta$ (\"theta\") if:\n\n$$\nE[\\hat{\\theta}] = \\theta\n$$\n\nBias or error, $\\epsilon$, is the difference between our estimate and the truth\n\n$$\n\\epsilon

(ICE), $\\tau_i$, is defined as\n\n$$\n\\tau_i \\equiv Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)\n$$\n\n-   The [fundamental problem of causal inference]{.blue} is that we only ever see one potential outcome for an individual, and so it's [impossible to know]{.blue} the causal effect of some intervention for that individual\n\n-   The ICE is [unidentified]{.blue}\n\n# {{< fa lightbulb >}} Causal Identification {.inverse}\n\n## Identification\n\n-   Identification refers to [what we can learn]{.blue} from the data available\n\n-   A quantity of interest is [identified]{.blue} if, with infinite data it can only take one value\n\n-   Mathematically, we'll sometimes say a coefficient in an equation is [unidentified]{.blue} if\n\n    -   We have more predictors than observations, or\n\n    -   Some of predictors are linear combinations of other predictors.\n\n## Causal Identification\n\n-   [Casual Identification]{.blue} refers to \"the assumptions needed for statistical estimates to be given a causal interpretation\" [Keele (2015)](http://lukekeele.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/causal.pdf)\n\n-   [What's Your Casual Identification Strategy]{.blue} What are the assumptions that make your research design credible?\n\n-   **Identification \\> Estimation**\n\n## Observational vs Experimental Designs\n\n-   [Experimental designs]{.blue} are studies in which a causal variable of interest, the *treatement*, is [manipulated by the researcher]{.blue} to examine its causal effects on some *outcome* of interest\n\n-   [Observational designs]{.blue} are studies in which a causal variable of interest is determined by someone/thing [other than the researcher]{.blue} (nature, governments, people, etc.)\n\n# {{< fa lightbulb >}} Causal Identification in Experimental Designs {.inverse}\n\n## The FPoCI is a problem of missing data {.smaller}\n\nRecall that an individual causal effect $\\tau_i$, is defined as:\n\n$$\n\\tau_i \\equiv Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)\n$$\n\nThe problem is that for any one individual, we only observe $Y_i(1)$ or $Y_i(0)$, but never both.\n\n-   If Paul got the vaccine $(Y_{Paul}(Vaxxed)=\\text{Covid Free})$, then we don't know what Paul's health status would have been, had he not got the vaccine $(Y_{Paul}(Unvaxxed) =???)$\n\n## A statistical solution to the FPoCI {.smaller}\n\nRather than focus individual causal effects:\n\n$$\n\\tau_i \\equiv Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)\n$$\n\nWe focus on average causal effects (Average Treatment Effects \\[ATEs\\]):\n\n$$\nE[\\tau_i] = \\overbrace{E[Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)]}^{\\text{Average of a difference}} = \\overbrace{E[Y_i(1)] - E[Y_i(0)]}^{\\text{Difference of Averages}}\n$$\n\nWhen does the difference of averages provide us with a good estimate of the average difference?\n\nLet's consider a simple example\n\n## Does eating chocolate make you happy?\n\n-   $Y_i$ happiness measured on a 0-10 scale\n\n-   $D_i$ whether a person ate [chocolate]{style=\"color: chocolate\"} $(D=1)$ or [fruit]{style=\"color: purple\"} $(D =

{.cell-output-display}\n![](03-slides_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-35-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Why Random Assignment Matters? {.smaller}\n\nFormally, randomly assigning treatments creates [statistical independence]{.blue} $(\\unicode{x2AEB})$ between treatment ( $D$ ) and potential outcomes ( $Y(1),Y(0)$ ) as well as any observed ( $X$ ) or unobserved confounders ( $U$ ):\n\n$$Y_i(1),Y_i(0),\\mathbf{X_i},\\mathbf{U_i} \\unicode{x2AEB} D_i$$\n\nPractically, what this means is that what we can observe ( differences in conditional means for [treated]{.blue} and [control]{.blue} ), provide good ([unbiased]{.blue}) estimates of what we're trying to learn about ([Average Treatment Effects]{.blue})\n\n## Causal Identification with Experimental Designs {.smaller}\n\nCausal identification for experimental designs requires very few assumptions:\n\n-   [Independence]{.blue} (Satisfied by Randomization)\n\n    -   $Y(1), Y(0),X,U, \\perp D$\n\n-   [SUTVA]{.blue} Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (Depends on features of the design)\n\n    -   No interference between units $Y_i(d_1, d_2, \\dots, d_N) = Y_i(d_i)$\n    -   No hidden values of the treatment/Variation in the treatment\n\n## Random assignment creates testable implications {.smaller}\n\n-   If treatment has been randomly assigned, we would expect treatment and control groups to [look similar]{.blue} in terms of [pre-treatment covariates]{.blue}\n\n    -   We can show [covariate balance]{.blue} by comparing the means in each treatment group\n\n-   If the treatment had an effect, than we can credibly claim that that effect was due to the presence or absence of the treatment, and not some alternative explanation.\n\n-   This type of clean [apples-to-apples]{.blue} counterfactual comparison is what people mean when they talk about an *experimental ideal*\n\n## No Causation without Manipulation?\n\n-   \"No causation without manipulation\" - [Holland (1986)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2289064)\n-   Causal effects are well defined when we can imagine manipulating (changing) the value of $D_i$ and only $D_i$\n-   But what about the \"effects\" of things like:\n    -   Race\n    -   Sex\n    -   Democracy\n-   Studying the effects of these factors requires strong theory and clever design [Sen and Wasow
