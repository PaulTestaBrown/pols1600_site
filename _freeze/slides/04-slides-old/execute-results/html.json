**Selection on Observables** is rarely a credible assumption\n- Observational designs that produce credible causal inference, leverage aspects of the world that create *natural experiments*\n- You should be able to describe the logic and assumptions of common designs in social science \n  - **Difference-in-Differences:** *Parallel Trends* \n  - **Regression Discontiniuity:** *Continuity at the cutoff*\n  - **Instrumental Variables:** Instruments need to be *Relevant and Exogenous*\n\n\n\nclass:inverse, middle, center\n# 💪\n## Get set up to work\n\n\n## New packages\n\nLet's try installing these packages manually: \n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"dataverse\")\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"tidycensus\")\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"easystats\", repos = \"https://easystats.r-universe.dev\")\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"DeclareDesign\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n- Some further guidance available [here](https://pols1600.paultesta.org/slides/04-packages.html)\n\n- Particular, for next week, please follow the instructions to [install a Census API key in R](https://pols1600.paultesta.org/slides/04-packages.html#3_Install_a_Census_API_tidycensus_package)\n\n\n## Packages for today\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Define a function to load (and if needed install) packages\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nipak <- function(pkg){\n    new.pkg <- pkg[!(pkg %in% installed.packages()[, \"Package\"])]\n    if (length(new.pkg)) \n        install.packages(new.pkg, dependencies = TRUE)\n    sapply(pkg, require, character.only = TRUE)\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Load packages for today\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nipak(the_packages)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n   kableExtra            DT     tidyverse     lubridate       forcats \n         TRUE          TRUE          TRUE          TRUE          TRUE \n        haven      labelled         ggmap       ggrepel      ggridges \n         TRUE          TRUE          TRUE          TRUE          TRUE \n     ggthemes        ggpubr        GGally        scales       dagitty \n         TRUE          TRUE          TRUE          TRUE          TRUE \n        ggdag       ggforce       COVID19          maps       mapdata \n         TRUE          TRUE          TRUE          TRUE          TRUE \n          qss    tidycensus     dataverse DeclareDesign     easystats \n         TRUE          TRUE          TRUE          TRUE          TRUE \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nclass:inverse, center, middle\n# 💪\n## Load Data for today\n\n\n## Load Data for today\n\nWe'll load the data we need in some of the examples below as well:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## Lab data\nload(url(\"https://pols1600.paultesta.org/files/data/03_lab.rda\"))\n\n## RDD data\nlibrary(qss)\ndata(MPs)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Review: What have we covered\n\n \n- Statistical Programming\n  -

If our data have missing values, we need to to tell `R` to remove them \n  \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmean(df$x, na.rm=T)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Conditional Means: Practical\n\n  \n- To calculate a conditional mean we could us a logical index `[df$z == 1]` \n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmean(df$x[df$z == 1], na.rm=T)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n--\n  \n- If we wanted to a calculate a lot of conditional means we could use the `mean()` in combination with `group_by()` and `summarise()`\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf %>% \n  group_by(z)%>%\n  summarise(\n    x = mean(x, na.rm=T)\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n## Mean: Definitional\n\nFormally, we  define the arithmetic mean of $x$ as $\\bar{x}$:\n\n$$\n\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n}\\left (\\sum_{i=1}^n{x_i}\\right ) = \\frac{x_1+x_2+\\cdots +x_n}{n}\n$$\n\nIn words, this formula says, to calculate the average of x, we sum up all the values of $x_i$ from observation $i=1$ to $i=n$ and then divide by the total number of observations $n$\n\n\n\n## Mean: Definitional\n\n- In this class, I don't put a lot of weight on memorizing definitions (that's what Google's for).\n\n- But being comfortable with \"the math\" is important and useful\n\n- Definitional knowledge is a prerequisite for understanding more theoretical claims.\n\n\n## Mean: Theoretical\n\nSuppose I asked you to show that the sum of deviations from a mean equals 0?\n\n$$\n\\text{Claim:} \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i -\\bar{x}) = 0\n$$\n\n\n## Mean: Theoretical\n\nKnowing the definition of an arithmetic mean, we could write: \n\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i -\\bar{x}) &= \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i - \\sum_{i=1}^n\\bar{x} & \\text{Distribute Summation}\\\\\n              &= \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i - n\\bar{x} & \\text{Summing a constant, } \\bar{x}\\\\\n              &= \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i - n\\times \\left ( \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n{x_i}\\right ) & \\text{Definition of } \\bar{x}\\\\\n              &= \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i -

E[Y_i |X_i, D_i=0]\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nThe average treatment effect is identified by the observed difference of means between treatment and control conditional on the values of $X$\n\n\n##  Causal Identification through Subclassification\n\n- Economists call $Y_i(1),Y_i(0) \\perp D_i |X_i$ an assumption of **Selection on Observables**\n  \n  - Controlling for what we can observe $X$, $D$ is conditionally independent of Potential Outcomes\n  \n  - Violated if there were some other factor, $U$ that influenced both $D$ and $Y$\n\n- $0 < Pr(D = 1|X) < 1$ is called an assumption of **Common Support**\n  \n  - There is a non-zero probability of receiving the treatment for all values of X\n  \n  - Violated if only one subgroup had access to the treatment (Vaccine by age group comparisons)\n\n\n##  Example of Subclassification\n\n- We used subclassification when we compared the unconditional rates of new Covid-19 cases by face mask policy to the conditional rates new cases by policy regime in each month of our data.\n  - Overall rates are misleading. \n  - Lots of things differ between January 2020 and January 2022\n  - Subclassification by month provides a \"fairer\" comparison\n  - But is it \"causal\"\n\n--\n- Even controlling for \"month\" there are other omitted variables:\n  - Other policies in place?\n  - Socio-economic differences between states\n  - Others?\n\n--\n- Trying to subclassify (stratify) comparisons on more than one or two variables gets hard\n  - **The Curse of Dimensionality**\n\n\n## The Curse of Dimensionality\n\n- As we try to control for more factors, the number of observations per dimension declines rapidly\n  - Men vs Women\n  - Men, ages 20-30 vs Men ages 30-40\n  - Men, ages 20-30 with college degrees and blue eyes vs Men  ages 20-30 with college degrees and green eyes\n\n- Subclassification with more than a few variables, will often produce a lack of common support: \n  - Not enough observations to make credible counterfactual comparisons\n\n\n## Matching\n\n- Matching refers to a broad set of procedures that essentially try to generalize subclassification to \n  - address to **curse of dimensionality**\n  - achieve balance on a range of observable covariates between **treated** and **control** groups\n\n- Many different types of matching procedures:\n\n  - **Exact matching:** Find exact matches between treatment and control observations for all covariates $X$\n  - **Coarsened exact matching:** Find approximate matches within ranges of values for $X$\n  - **Distance-metric matching:** Calculate a distance metric between observations based on their values of $X$, and match treated and control to minimize that distance\n  - **Propensity score matching:** Calculate the propsenity to receive treatment using $X$ to predict $D$ and treated and control based on their *propensity scores*\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/355318/images/Propensity-Score-Graphic.jpg){fig-align='center' width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n[Source](https://www.summitllc.us/propensity-score-matching)\n\n\n## Causal Identification with Matching (ICYI)\n\nMatching again requires an assumption of **selection on observables**\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\nY_i(1),Y_i(0) \\perp D_i |X_i && \\text{Selection on Observables}\\\\\n0 < Pr(D_i = 1|X_i) < 1  && \\text{Common Support}\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\n\nMatching procedures like propensity score matching, allow us to match treated and control observations based on a *propensity score*, a predicted value of receiving the treatment, $D$ based on observed variables, $X$.\n\n$$\np(X_i) = Pr(D=1|X_i) = \\pi_i\n$$\n\nAllowing us to estimate an ATE conditional on $\\pi_i$\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\nATE &= E[Y_i(1)- Y_i(0)|p(X_i) = \\pi_i] \\\\\n&= E[Y_i(1)- Y_i(0)|p(X_i) = \\pi_i, D_i=1]\\\\\n& = E[Y_i |p(X_i) = \\pi_i, D_i=1] -

a tool to make predictions\n  - by fitting lines to data\n\n- Theoretically, we will build towards an understanding of linear regression as a \"linear estimate of the conditional expectation function $(CEF = E[Y|X])$\n\n\n## Regression\n\nBroadly regression is a statistical procedural to help us model relationships that consists of:\n\n- $Y$ an **outcome variable** or thing we're trying to explain\n  -

$\\beta_0$ corresponds to the $y$ intercept, or the model's prediction when $x = 0$.\n  - $\\beta_1$ corresponds to the slope, or how $y$ is predicted to change as $x$ changes.\n\n\n## Linear Regression \n  \n- If you find this notation confusing, try plugging in substantive concepts for what $y$ and $x$ represent\n- Say we wanted to know how attitudes to transgender people varied with age in the baseline survey from Lab 03.\n\nThe generic linear model\n\n$$y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i + \\epsilon$$\n\nReflects:\n\n$$\\text{Transgender Feeling Thermometer}_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1\\text{Age}_i + \\epsilon_i$$\n\n\n## Estimating a Linear Regression\n\n- We estimate linear regressions in `R` using the `lm()` function.\n- `lm()` requires two arguments:\n  -

$Y_{1i}(t)$ the potential outcome of unit $i$ when treated between the two periods \n\n  - $Y_{0i}(t)$ the potential outcome of unit $i$ when control between the two periods \n\n\n## Causal Effects\n\nThe individual causal effect for unit i at time t is:\n\n$$\\tau_{it} = Y_{1i}(t) − Y_{0i}(t)$$\n\nWhat we observe is \n\n$$Y_i(t) = Y_{0i}(t)\\cdot(1 − D_i(t)) + Y_{1i}(t)\\cdot D_i(t)$$\n\n$D$ only equals 1, when $T$ equals 1, so we never observe $Y_0i(1)$ for the treated units. \n\nIn words, we don't know what Lambeth's outcome would have been in the second period, had they not been treated.\n\n\n## Average Treatment on Treated\n\nOur goal is to estimate the average effect of treatment on treated (ATT):\n\n\n$$\\tau_{ATT} = E[Y_{1i}(1) -  Y_{0i}(1)|D=1]$$\n\nThat is, what would have happened in Lambeth, had their water company not moved their pipes\n\n\n## Average Treatment on Treated\n\nOur goal is to estimate the average effect of treatment on treated (ATT):\n\nWe we can observe is:\n\n|               | Pre-Period (T=0)  | Post-Period (T=1)  |\n||--|-|\n| Treated $D_{i}=1$  |  $E[Y_{0i}(0)\\vert D_i = 1]$ | $E[Y_{1i}(1)\\vert D_i = 1]$  |\n| Control $D_i=0$  |  $E[Y_{0i}(0)\\vert D_i = 0]$ | $E[Y_{0i}(1)\\vert D_i = 0]$  |\n\n\n## Data\n\nBecause potential outcomes notation is abstract, let's consider a modified description of the Snow's cholera death data from [Scott Cunningham](https://mixtape.scunning.com/difference-in-differences.html):\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Company </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1849 (T=0) </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1854 (T=1) </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Lambeth (D=1) </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 85 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 19 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Southwark and Vauxhall (D=0 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 135 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 147 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## How can we estimate the effect of moving pumps upstream?\n\nRecall, our goal is to estimate the effect of the the treatment on the treated:\n\n$$\\tau_{ATT} = E[Y_{1i}(1) -  Y_{0i}(1)|D=1]$$\n\nLet's conisder some strategies Snow could take to estimate this quantity:\n\n\n## Before vs after comparisons:\n\n- Snow could have compared Labmeth in 1854 $(E[Y_i(1)|D_i = 1] = 19)$ to Lambeth in 1849 $(E[Y_i(0)|D_i = 1]=85)$, and claimed that moving the pumps upstream led to **66 fewer cholera deaths.** \n\n- Assumes Lambeth's pre-treatment outcomes in 1849 are a good proxy for what its outcomes would have been in 1954 if the pumps hadn't moved $(E[Y_{0i}(1)|D_i = 1])$.\n\n- A skeptic might argue that Lambeth in 1849 $\\neq$ Lambeth in 1854\n\n\n\n## Treatment-Control comparisons in the Post Period.\n\n- Snow could have compared outcomes between Lambeth and S&V in 1954  ($E[Yi(1)|Di = 1] − E[Yi(1)|Di = 0]$), concluding that the change in pump locations led to **128 fewer deaths.**\n\n- Here the assumption is that the outcomes in S&V and in 1854 provide a good proxy for what would have happened in Lambeth in 1954 had the pumps not been moved $(E[Y_{0i}(1)|D_i = 1])$\n\n- Again, our skeptic could argue  Lambeth $\\neq$ S&V \n\n\n## Difference in Differences\n\nTo address these concerns, Snow employed what we now call a difference-in-differences design, \n\nThere are two, equivalent ways to view this design. \n\n$$\\underbrace{\\{E[Y_{i}(1)|D_{i} = 1] − E[Y_{i}(1)|D_{i} = 0]\\}}_{\\text{1. Treat-Control |Post }}− \\overbrace{\\{E[Y_{i}(0)|D_{i} = 1] − E[Y_{i}(0)|D_{i}=0 ]}^{\\text{Treated-Control|Pre}}$$\n\n- Difference 1: Average change between Treated and Control  in Post Period\n- Difference 2: Average change between Treated and Control  in Pre Period\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\n$$\\underbrace{\\{E[Y_{i}(1)|D_{i} = 1] − E[Y_{i}(0)|D_{i} = 1]\\}}_{\\text{Post - Pre |Treated }}− \\overbrace{\\{E[Y_{i}(1)|D_{i} = 0] − E[Y_{i}(0)|D_{i}=0 ]}^{\\text{Post-Pre|Control}}$$\n\n\n- Difference 1: Average change between Treated over time\n- Difference 2: Average change between Control over time\n\n\n## Difference in Differences\n\n\nYou'll see the DiD design represented both ways, but they produce the same result:\n\n$$\n\\tau_{ATT} = (19-147) - (85-135) = -78\n$$\n\n$$\n\\tau_{ATT} = (19-85) - (147-135) = -78\n$$\n\n\n## Identifying Assumption of a Difference in Differences Design\n\nThe key assumption in this design is what's known as the parallel trends assumption: $E[Y_{0i}(1) − Y_{0i}(0)|D_i = 1] = E[Y_{0i}(1) − Y_{0i}(0)|D_i = 0]$ \n\n- In words: If Lambeth hadn't moved its pumps, it would have followed a similar path as S&V\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](04-slides-old_files/figure-html/paralleltrends-1.png){fig-align='center' width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nWhere:\n\n1. $E[Y_{i}(1)|D_{i} = 1] − E[Y_{i}(1)|D_{i} = 0]$\n2. $E[Y_{i}(0)|D_{i} = 1] − E[Y_{i}(0)|D_{i}\\} = 0]$\n3. $E[Y_{1i}(1) − Y_{0i}(1)|D_{i} = 1]$\n\n\n\n## Summary\n\n- A Difference in Differences (DiD, or diff-in-diff) design combines a pre-post comparison, with a treated and control comparison\n  \n  - Taking the pre-post difference removes any fixed differences between the units\n  \n  - Then taking the difference between treated and control differences removes any common differences over time\n\n- The key identifying assumption of a DiD design is the \"assumption of parallel trends\"\n  - Absent treatment, treated and control groups\nwould see the same changes over time.\n  - Hard to prove, possible to test\n\n\n\n## Extensions and limitations\n\n- DiD easy to estimate with linear regression\n- Generalizes to multiple periods and treatment interventions\n  - More pre-treatment periods allow you assess \"parallel trends\" assumption\n- Alternative methods \n  - Synthetic control\n  - Event Study Designs\n- What if you have multiple treatments or treatments that come and go?\n  - Panel Matching\n  - Generalized Synthetic control\n\n\n## Applications\n\n- [Card and Krueger (1994)](https://www.nber.org/papers/w4509) What effect did raising the minimum wage in NJ have on employment\n\n- [Abadie, Diamond, & Hainmueller (2014)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ajps.12116?casa_token=_ceCu4SwzTEAAAAA%3AP9aeaZpT_Zh1VdWKXx_tEmzaJTtMJ1n0eG7EaYlvJZYN000re33cfMAI2O8N8htFJjOsln2GyVeQql4) What effect did German Unification have on economic development in West Germany\n\n- [Malesky, Nguyen and Tran (2014)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/impact-of-recentralization-on-public-services-a-differenceindifferences-analysis-of-the-abolition-of-elected-councils-in-vietnam/3477854BAAFE152DC93C594169D64F58) How does decentralization influence public services?\n\n\nclass: inverse, center, middle\n# 💡 Regression Discontinuity Design\n\n\n## Motivating Example\n\n.pull-left[\n- Do Members of Parliament in the UK get richer from holding office (QSS Chapter 4.3.4)\n]\n.pull-right[\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](./images/04_eggers.png){fig-align='center' width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n[Eggers and Hainmueller (2009)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/abs/mps-for-sale-returns-to-office-in-postwar-british-politics/E4C2B102194AA1EA0D2F1F777EAE3C08)\n]\n\n\n\n## Logic of the Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) \n\n- What's the effect of holding elected office in the UK on personal wealth?\n\n- People who win elections differ in many ways from people who lose elections.\n\n- Logic of an RDD: \n\n  -
