[Mean](https://pols1600.paultesta.org/labs/01-lab-comments.html#mean)\n  - [Median](https://pols1600.paultesta.org/labs/01-lab-comments.html#median)\n  - [Mode](https://pols1600.paultesta.org/labs/01-lab-comments.html#modes)\n\n- [How much do our data vary?]{.blue}\n  -

Think about the average height in our class ([unconditional mean]{.blue}) vs the average height among men and women ([conditional means].{blue})\n\n\n\n## Mean as a balancing point\n\n\n![](https://mathbitsnotebook.com/Algebra1/StatisticsData/balancepoint1.jpg)\n\n[Source](https://mathbitsnotebook.com/Algebra1/StatisticsData/STCenter.html)\n\n\n## Mean: Practical\n\nThere are lots of ways to calculate means in `R`\n\n- The simplest is to use the `mean()` function\n  \n  - If our data have missing values, we need to to tell `R` to remove them \n  \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n## Conditional Means: Practical\n\n  \n- To calculate a conditional mean we could us a logical index `[df$z == 1]` \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n  \n- If we wanted to a calculate a lot of conditional means we could use the `mean()` in combination with `group_by()` and `summarise()`\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Mean: Definitional\n\nFormally, we  define the arithmetic mean of $x$ as $\\bar{x}$:\n\n$$\n\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n}\\left (\\sum_{i=1}^n{x_i}\\right ) = \\frac{x_1+x_2+\\cdots +x_n}{n}\n$$\n\nIn words, this formula says, to calculate the average of x, we sum up all the values of $x_i$ from observation $i=1$ to $i=n$ and then divide by the total number of observations $n$\n\n\n\n## Mean: Definitional\n\n- In this class, I don't put a lot of weight on memorizing definitions (that's what Google's for).\n\n- But being comfortable with \"the math\" is important and useful\n\n- Definitional knowledge is a prerequisite for understanding more theoretical claims.\n\n\n## Mean: Theoretical\n\nSuppose I asked you to show that the sum of deviations from a mean equals 0?\n\n$$\n\\text{Claim:} \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i -\\bar{x}) = 0\n$$\n\n\n## Mean: Theoretical{.smaller}\n\nKnowing the definition of an arithmetic mean, we could write: \n\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i -\\bar{x}) &= \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i - \\sum_{i=1}^n\\bar{x} & \\text{Distribute Summation}\\\\\n              &= \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i - n\\bar{x} & \\text{Summing a constant, } \\bar{x}\\\\\n              &= \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i - n\\times \\left ( \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n{x_i}\\right ) & \\text{Definition of } \\bar{x}\\\\\n              &= \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i -

\\hat{x_i})^2)$ \n\n\n\n\n## Mean: Theoretical\n\nOccasionally, you'll read or here me say  say things like:\n\n> The sample mean is an unbiased estimator of the population mean\n\nIn a statistics class, we would take time to prove this.\n\n\n\n## The sample mean is an unbiased estimator of the population mean\n\nClaim:\n\nLet $x_1, x_2, \\dots x_n$ from a random sample from a population with mean $\\mu$ and variance $\\sigma^2$\n\nThen:\n\n$$\n\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n}\\left (\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\\right )\n$$\n\nis an unbiased estimator of $\\mu$\n\n$$\nE[\\bar{x}] = \\mu\n$$\n\n\n## The sample mean is an unbiased estimator of the population mean {.smaller}\n\n\nProof:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nE\\left [\\bar{x} \\right] &= E\\left [\\frac{1}{n}\\left (\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i \\right) \\right] & \\text{Definition of } \\bar{x} \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^nE\\left [ x_i \\right]  & \\text{Linearity of Expectations} \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\mu  & E[x_i] = \\mu \\\\\n&= \\frac{n}{n}  \\mu  & \\sum_{i=1}^n \\mu = n\\mu \\\\\n&= \\mu  & \\blacksquare \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n\n\n## Levels of understanding {.smaller}\n:::{.nonincremental}\nIn this course, we tend to emphasize the \n\n- **Conceptual**\n\n- **Practical**\n\nOver\n\n- Definitional\n\n- Theoretical\n\n\nIn an intro statistics class, the ordering might be reversed.\n\nTrade offs:\n\n:::\n\n- Pro: We actually get to *work with data* and *do empirical research* much sooner\n- Cons: We substitute intuitive understandings for more rigorous proofs\n\n\n# {{< fa lightbulb >}} Causal Identification with Observational Designs {.inverse}\n\n# {{< fa lightbulb >}} Covariate Adjustment {.inverse}\n\n# {{< fa lightbulb >}} Simple Linear Regression {.inverse}\n\n# {{< fa lightbulb >}} Difference-in-Differences {.inverse}\n\n\n\n\n## Summary\n\n## References\n",
