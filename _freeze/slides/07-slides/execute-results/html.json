vary the values of the predictor you're interested in\n  - hold all the other predictors in your model constant at some typical value.\n- Input the model from `lm()` and the [prediction data frame]{.blue}, into the `predict()` function to obtain [predicted values]{.blue}. \n  - Save predictions as a new column in your [prediction data frame]{.blue} (I generally call them `fit`)\n- Plot predicted values in your [prediction data frame]{.blue} to help interpret your model\n\n## {.smaller}\n#### Are there decreasing returns to vaccination?\n\n:::: panel-tabset\n\n## Task\n\nSuppose we thought the [marginal effect]{.blue} -- (here, predicted change in deaths from a 1 percent increase in the percent of the population vaccinated) of vaccines varied.\n\nThere might be large gains from going to low to average rates of vaccination, but after a certain threshold, the decreases in deaths would taper off.\n\nWe could test this by including a [polynomial term]{.blue} `I(percent_vaccinated)^2` in our model.\n\nIncluding a polynomial term, allows the marginal effect to vary, based on the value of the predictor.\n\nIt's hard to interpret the coefficients on [polynomial terms]{.blue} (or interaction terms) just by looking at coefficients in a table\n\nInstead, we'll produce a plot of predicted values to test these claims\n\n## {{<fa code >}} m4\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nm4 <- lm(new_deaths_pc_14day ~ percent_vaccinated + I(percent_vaccinated^2) + rep_voteshare_std + med_age_std + med_income_std, covid_lab\n           )\n```\n:::\n\n\n## {{<fa table >}} Table\n\n\n<table class=\"texreg\" style=\"margin: 10px auto;border-collapse: collapse;border-spacing: 0px;caption-side: bottom;color: #000000;border-top: 2px solid #000000;\">\n<caption>Statistical models</caption>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"padding-left: 5px;padding-right: 5px;\">&nbsp;</th>\n<th style=\"padding-left: 5px;padding-right: 5px;\">Model 1</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"border-top: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<td style=\"padding-left: 5px;padding-right: 5px;\">(Intercept)</td>\n<td style=\"padding-left: 5px;padding-right: 5px;\">6.194<sup>&#42;&#42;</sup></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding-left: 5px;padding-right: 5px;\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td style=\"padding-left: 5px;padding-right: 5px;\">(2.186)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding-left: 5px;padding-right: 5px;\">percent_vaccinated</td>\n<td style=\"padding-left: 5px;padding-right: 5px;\">-0.169<sup>&#42;</sup></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding-left: 5px;padding-right: 5px;\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td style=\"padding-left: 5px;padding-right: 5px;\">(0.077)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding-left: 5px;padding-right: 5px;\">percent_vaccinated^2</td>\n<td style=\"padding-left: 5px;padding-right: 5px;\">0.001</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding-left: 5px;padding-right: 5px;\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td style=\"padding-left: 5px;padding-right: 5px;\">(0.001)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding-left: 5px;padding-right: 5px;\">rep_voteshare_std</td>\n<td style=\"padding-left: 5px;padding-right: 5px;\">-0.062</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding-left: 5px;padding-right: 5px;\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td style=\"padding-left: 5px;padding-right: 5px;\">(0.081)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding-left: 5px;padding-right: 5px;\">med_age_std</td>\n<td style=\"padding-left: 5px;padding-right: 5px;\">0.053</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding-left: 5px;padding-right: 5px;\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td style=\"padding-left: 5px;padding-right: 5px;\">(0.053)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding-left: 5px;padding-right: 5px;\">med_income_std</td>\n<td style=\"padding-left: 5px;padding-right: 5px;\">-0.114</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding-left: 5px;padding-right: 5px;\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td style=\"padding-left: 5px;padding-right: 5px;\">(0.068)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"border-top: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<td style=\"padding-left: 5px;padding-right: 5px;\">R<sup>2</sup></td>\n<td style=\"padding-left: 5px;padding-right: 5px;\">0.561</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding-left: 5px;padding-right: 5px;\">Adj.
