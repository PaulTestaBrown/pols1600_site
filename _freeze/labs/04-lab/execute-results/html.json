Things like `for()` loops, `functions()` and `apply()` can reduce the amount of copying, pasting and replacing you have to do, which in turn can reduce the amount of errors induced by forgetting to change a variable name, or mistyping a command.\n\nBut the first time you see a for loop, or define your own function, it will likely seem a bit abstract, and obtuse.That's ok. The goal is that you have a better, if not perfect, understanding of these concepts which we will use throughout the course.\n\n# Read Ferwerda and Miller (2014) and answer the following:\n\n-   **What's the research question?**\n-   **What's the theoretical framework?**\n-   **What's the empirical design?**\n-   **What's are the main results?**\n\n# Load the replication data and set up your workspace\n\nPlease run the following command to load the data:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load the data\nload(url(\"https://pols2580.paultesta.org/files/data/04_lab.rda\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\nAnd write code to load any packages you think you might need to analyze the data.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Libraries\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe next commands tell us a little about the dataset.

There's no way to really prove this claim, but we can test some of its observable implications.\n\nSpecifically, if the Germans essentially drew the demarcation line at random (at least relative to the local boundaries of specific communes), then the observable characteristics of communes north of the line (under German occupation) and south of the line (under Vichy rule) should be similar.\n\n# Calculate the means and differences of means for all communes north and south of the demarcation line for the following variables:\n\n-   **distancetotrain**: Distance to nearest train station from center of commune\n-   **communications**: Ordinal variable treated as interval indicating whether a commune had a telephone bureau (3?), a telegraph station (2?), or a post office (1?) or none of these (0?) in 1939\n-   **hectares_scaled**: number of actively farmed hectares as a proxy for forest cover and urbanization\n-   **population**: Population from the 1936 census\n-   **pctright**: Vote shares for the Right from the 1936 national legislative elections\n-   **pctleft**: Vote shares for the Left from the 1936 national legislative elections\n-   **sd_elev250**: The standard deviation of elevation using resampled 250m resolution SRTM elevation data; a proxy for Ruggedness of Terrain\n-   **near_km**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Write your code here\n# You might find something like the following useful\n\n# # List of covariates\n# the_vars<-c(\"distancetotrain\",\"communications\",\"hectares_scaled\",\"population\",\n#           \"pctright\",\"pctleft\",\"sd_elev250\",\"near_km\")\n# \n# # Holders for means\n# north_means<-c()\n# south_means<-c()\n# \n# #Replace ???? in code below with some useful logical statement\n# for(i in the_vars){\n#     print(paste(\"Now summarizing\",i))\n#     north_means[i]<-mean(wrk[????,i])\n#     south_means[i]<-mean(wrk[????,i])\n# \n# \n# }\n```\n:::\n\n\n**Answer:**\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo how should we make sense of these differences? Are they substantively large? Do they provide support for or against a claim that the demarcation lines is \"as if\" random?\n\nAnswering these questions has proved difficult, since different variables are measured on different scales, and it's hard to quantify what big is.\n\nLast week, we saw that we could assess these differences relative to a claim about the world (\"i.e. if there were no difference between theses groups, how likely is it that we would a difference as large as we did\").\n\nToday, we'll consider another way of thinking about how big differences are, which is to think about how much the difference might vary.\n\nWe know from our first week on measurement, that things like variance and standard deviations can be used to describe the spread of a random variable's distribution (how much observations tend to vary around their means).\n\nMeans and differences of means are functions of variables, and so we can think about these quantities as having their own distributions and spreads.\n\nSo one way to compare the magnitude of the differences you calcuated above, is to standardize each difference by its standard error -- that is, we could divide each difference by the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of that difference (how much we might expect that difference to vary). Don't worry about the terminology right now--we'll cover these concepts in greater detail later in the course.\n\nFor now, we'll use as a rough rule of thumb, that **standardized differences greater than 2 are \"big,\"** that is, they are unlikely to arise by chance and thus provide evidence against the claim that the demarcation line was drawn as if random.\n\nThe code below **defines a function** to calculate these standardized differences and returns the standardized difference (as well as the means, difference of means, and standard error of that difference) for the `distancetotrain` variable.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstd_diff_fn <- function(x){\n  # inputs\n  # x: the variable we want to calculate a standardized difference of\n  stopifnot(is.character(x))\n  \n  #1.

So this modified function can calculate conditional means for a subset of observations (communes) within `c` kilometers of the demarcation line.\n\n# Does this claim appear more or less plausible within 10 km of the line?\n\nUse `sapply()` with `new_std_diff_fn()` to calculate the standardized differences for the covariates in `the_vars` for communes within 10 km north or south of the demarcation line (i.e., c=10).\n\nEvaluate these differences as they relate to F&M's claim of \"as-if\" randomization.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Write your code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n**Answer:**\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo the identifying assumption seems more plausible for communes closer to the demarcation line. Now let's estimate the \"effect\" of German rule on resistance activity (sabotage and fighting) for the full sample and for the subset of communes within 10 km of the demarcation line.\n\n# Does devolution reduce resistance?\n\nCalculate the difference in the mean number of sabotage events and fighting events for communes north and south of the demarcation line, for the full sample of communes and the communes within 10 km of the demarcation line. Provide a substantive interpretation of these differences.\n\nYou can use logical indexing, or the `new_std_diff_fn` if you'd like.
