Then, I'll need to get the data. And then...\")\n-   **Think and write programmatically**\n    -   In this .Rmd file, I'll first ask you to outline, conceptually, all the steps you'll need to do to produce this figure.\n    -   Don't worry if you can't think of all the necessary steps or aren't sure of the order. We'll produce a collective outline of what we need to do before getting to the actual coding\n    -   When we do code, I'll ask you to organize your code as outlined below:\n        -   Separate your steps into sections using the `#` headers in Markdown\n        -   Write a brief overview in words that a normal human can understand, what the code in that section is doing\n        -   Paste the code for that section into a code chunk\n        -   Add brief comments to this code to help your reader understand what's happening\n        -   Knit your document after completing each section.\n-   **Mapping concepts to code**\n    -   Again you shouldn't have to write much code. Just copy and paste from the labs and slides.\n    -   Your goal for today is to interpret that code and develop a mental map that allows you to say when I want to do this type of task (say \"recode data\"), I need to use some combination of these functions (`%>%`, `mutate()`, maybe `group_by()` or `case_when()`)\n    -   But shouldn't we be writing our own code?! Yes. Sure. Eventually.\n    -   The tutorials give you practice writing single commands, and by the end of the class you should be able write this code like this for to accomplish similar tasks\n    -   But even then, you will not be writing code from memory. I still have to Google functions, and often search my old code to find a clever solution to task.\n    -   Everyone starts learning to code by copying and pasting other people's code.\n    -   This will help minimize (but not eliminate) syntactic errors, while over time we get better writing code from scratch and fixing errors as the develop.\n-   **Practice wrangling data**\n    -   How do you load data?\n    -   How do you look at data?\n    -   How do you transform data?\n-   **Practice visualizing data**\n    -   Using the grammar of graphics to translate raw data into visual graphics\n    -   Understanding the components of this grammar:\n        -   data\n        -   aesthetics\n        -   geometries\n        -   facets\n        -   statistics\n        -   coordinates\n        -   themes\n    -   Exploring what happens when we change these components\n\nWe'll work in pairs and periodically check in as a class to check our progress, review concepts, and share insights.\n\nFor fun, let's say that the first group that successfully recreates this figure gets to choose one of the following non-monetary prizes:\n\n-   I'll tell them a joke\n-   One AMA I will answer truthfully\n-   One question to be asked on the weekly class survey\n-   0.00001% extra credit added to their final grade for the course.\n\nIf we finish early, you're free to go. If you want, we can take some time to [explore some additional figures](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/index.html){target=\"_blank\"} we might produce like [maps](https://jtr13.github.io/cc19/different-ways-of-plotting-u-s-map-in-r.html){target=\"_blank\"} or [lollipop](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/lollipop-plot.html){target=\"_blank\"} plots.\n\nOk, let's begin!\n\n# Please knit this .Rmd file {.unnumbered}\n\nFor every lab:\n\n-   Download the file\n-   Save it in your course folder\n-   Knit the document\n-   Open the html file in your browser (Easier to read)\n-   Knit the document again after completing a section or chunk (Error checking)\n-   Upload the final lab to [Canvas](https://canvas.brown.edu/courses/1091286/assignments/7925685?module_item_id=10882025){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\n# Describe the components of the figure you're trying to reprodce\n\nRecall, that we need `data`, `aesthetic` mappings and `geometries` to produce a figure\n\n-   What are the aesthetic mappings in this plot\n-   What is the geometry?\n-   What is the data set used? (Hint it's a transformation of `covid_us`)\n\n# Outline the steps you will need to complete this process {.unnumbered}\n\n# Step 1\n\nDescribe in words what your code below is doing\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Write the code for Step 1 here\n```\n:::\n\n\n# Step 2\n\nPerhaps Step 2 has multiple parts and code chunks\n\nUse sub headers to break down step 2 into its constituent parts\n\n## Step 2.1\n\nDescribe briefly (in a sentence or two or a couple of bullet points) what this section does\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Write the code for Step 2.1 here\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Step 2.2\n\nDescribe briefly (in a sentence or two or a couple of bullet points) what this section does\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Write the code for Step 2.2 here\n```\n:::\n\n\n# CLASS SURVEY\n\nFinally, please take a moment to complete this week's [class survey](https://brown.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_cYlY1R3DBzmFthI)\n",
