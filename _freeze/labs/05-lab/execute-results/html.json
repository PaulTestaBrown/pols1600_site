Lower rates of vaccination among Republicans have in turn led to higher rates of death from Covid-19 in Red States compared to Blue States.\n\nIn this lab, we'll reproduce some basic evidence of this phenomena, using bivariate linear regression as a tool to summarize and describe relationships.\n\nNext week, we'll see how multiple regression (linear regression with multiple predictors) can be used to assess alternative explanations for the patterns we see.\n\nTo accomplish this we will:\n\n1.  Set up our work space (2-3 Minutes)\n\n2.  Load data on Covid-19 and the 2020 Election. (5 Minutes)\n\n3.  Describe the structure of these two datasets (5 Minutes)\n\n4.  Transform the datasets so we can analyze them (10 minutes)\n\n5.  Merge the election data into our Covid-19 data (5 minues)\n\n6.  Calculate the average number new Covid-19 deaths in Red and Blue States (5 minutes)\n\n7.  Calculate the average number new Covid-19 deaths in Red and B Blue States using linear regression (10 minutes)\n\n8.  Explore the relationships between Republican vote share, vaccination rates, and deaths from Covid-19 on September 23, 2021 (10 minutes)\n\n9.  Visualize the relationships between Republican vote share, vaccination rates, and deaths from Covid-19 on September 23, 2021 (15-20 minutes)\n\n10. Discuss some alternative explanations for these relationships (5-10 minutes)\n\n11. Take the weekly survey (2-3 minutes)\n\nOne of these 10 tasks (excluding the weekly survey) will be randomly selected as the graded question for the lab.\n\nYou will work in your assigned groups. **Only one member of each group needs to submit the html file of lab.**\n\nThis lab **must** contain the names of the group members in attendance.\n\nIf you are attending remotely, you will submit your labs individually.\n\nHere are your assigned groups for the semester.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nRows: 8 Columns: 5\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (5): Group, 1, 2, 3, 4\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"datatables html-widget html-fill-item\" id=\"htmlwidget-3ee879aeb9d49f617399\" style=\"width:100%;height:auto;\"></div>\n<script type=\"application/json\" data-for=\"htmlwidget-3ee879aeb9d49f617399\">{\"x\":{\"filter\":\"none\",\"vertical\":false,\"data\":[[\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\",\"5\",\"6\",\"7\",\"8\"],[\"Group 1\",\"Group 2\",\"Group 3\",\"Group 4\",\"Group 5\",\"Group 6\",\"Group 7\",\"Group 8\"],[\"Maia Eng\",\"Andrew Rovinsky\",\"Serafym Rybachkivskyi\",\"Tiffany Eddy\",\"Christopher Maron\",\"Mia Hamilton\",\"Mariana Melzer\",\"Logan Szittai\"],[\"Guadalupe Herrera\",\"Spencer Lorin\",\"Rachel Kim\",\"Daniel Solomon\",\"Daniel Baker\",\"Emily Colon\",\"Kahrie Langham\",\"Keiley Thompson\"],[\"Stephen Robinson\",\"Lucinda Anderson\",\"Kai Blades\",\"Zoe Smith\",\"Neve Diaz-Carr\",\"Davis Kelly\",\"Shannon Feerick-Hillenbrand\",\"Lydell Dyer\"],[\"Jeremiah Harrington\",\"Serenity Hamilton\",\"Emma Coleman\",\"Lorena Calderon\",\"Olivia Hanley\",\"Talia Levine\",\"Jarret Fernandes\",\"Mahir Arora\"]],\"container\":\"<table class=\\\"display\\\">\\n  <thead>\\n    <tr>\\n      <th> <\\/th>\\n      <th>Group<\\/th>\\n      <th>1<\\/th>\\n      <th>2<\\/th>\\n      <th>3<\\/th>\\n      <th>4<\\/th>\\n    <\\/tr>\\n  <\\/thead>\\n<\\/table>\",\"options\":{\"columnDefs\":[{\"orderable\":false,\"targets\":0},{\"name\":\" \",\"targets\":0},{\"name\":\"Group\",\"targets\":1},{\"name\":\"1\",\"targets\":2},{\"name\":\"2\",\"targets\":3},{\"name\":\"3\",\"targets\":4},{\"name\":\"4\",\"targets\":5}],\"order\":[],\"autoWidth\":false,\"orderClasses\":false}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}</script>\n```\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Goals {.unnumbered}\n\nConceptually, this lab is designed to help reinforce the relationship between linear models like $y=\\beta_0 + \\beta_1x$ and the conditional expectation function $E[Y|X]$.\n\n- Questions 1-5 are designed to reinforce your **data wrangling** skills. In particular, you will get practice:\n\n  - Creating and recoding variables using `mutate()`\n  - Calculating a [moving average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average) or rolling mean using the `rollmean()` function from the `zoo` package\n  - Transforming the data on presidential elections so that it can be merged with the data on Covid-19 using the `pivot_wider()` function.\n  - [Merging data](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html) together using the `left_join()` function.\n\n- In question 6, you will see how calculating conditional means provides a simple test of \"Red Covid\" claim.\n\n- In question 7, you will see how a linear model returns the same information as these conditional means (in a sligthly different format)\n\n- In question 8, you will get practice interpreting linear models with continuous predictors (i.e. predictors that take on a range of values)\n\n- In question 9, you will get practice visualizing these models and using the figures help interpret your results substantively.\n\n- Question 10 asks you to play the role of a skeptic and consider what other factors might explain the relationships we found in Questions 6-9. We will explore these factors in next week's lab.\n\n# Please render this .qmd file {.unnumbered}\n\nAs with every lab, you should:\n\n- Download the file\n- Save it in your course folder\n- **Update the `author:` section of the YAML header to include the names of your group members in attendance.**\n- Render the document (Check `[X] Render on Save`)\n- Open the html file in your browser (Easier to read)\n- Render the document again after completing a section or chunk (Error checking)\n- Upload the final lab to [Canvas](https://canvas.brown.edu/courses/1094972/assignments){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\n# Set up your workspace\n\n1.  **In the code chunk below, please set up your work space by loading more packages, using the [code from Tuesday's class](https://pols1600.paultesta.org/slides/05-slides.html#/q1-setup-your-workspace){target=\"_blank\"}**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# List of packages\n\n\n\n# Define ipak function to load packages\n\n\n# Use ipak function to load packages\n```\n:::\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Load the data for today.\n\nNext we'll load data to explore the phenomenon of *Red Covid*\n\n## Load Covid-19 data\n\nFirst we'll need data on Covid-19 cases and deaths that we've worked with throughout the course.\n\n**In the chunk below, please write code to load data on Covid-19 in the states using the `covid19()` function from the `COVID19` package.

To explore the concept of *Red Covid*, we'll need to add data on the 2020 election to distinguish Red States from Blue States.\n\nTo accomplish this, we're going to need to:\n\n- Recode the Covid-19 data like we've done before\n- Reshape, recode, and filter the presidential election data.\n\n## Recode the Covid-19 data\n\nIn the chunk below, **please recode the `covid` data to create a `covid_us` data set**, again using code from the slides as your guide: [here](https://pols1600.paultesta.org/slides/05-slides.html#/q4.1-recode-the-covid-19){target=\"_blank\"} \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Create a vector containing of US territories\n\n\n# Filter out Territories and create state variable\n\n\n# Calculate new cases, new cases per capita, and 7-day average\n\n\n\n# Recode facemask policy (Not strictly necessary so feel free to skip)\n\n\n# Create year-month and percent vaccinated variables\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Create new measures of the 7-day and 14-day averages of new deaths from Covid-19 per 100,000 residents\n\nUsing the code from this [slide](https://pols1600.paultesta.org/slides/05-slides.html#/q4.1-recode-the-covid-19){target=\"_blank\"} as a guide:\n\n- Anywhere you see `new_cases` write `new_deaths`\n- Anywhere you see `confirmed` write `deaths`\n- For the 14-day average, copy the code for `new_deaths_pc_7day` change the `new_deaths_pc_7day` to `new_deaths_pc_14day` and set `k=14` in the `zoo::rollmean()`\n- Remember to save the output of `mutate()` back into `covid_us`\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Create the following variables:\n# new_deaths\n# new_deaths_pc\n# new_deaths_pc_7day\n# new_deaths_pc_14day\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Reshape and recode the presidential election data.\n\nWe want to add election data to our Covid-19 data. To do this, we need to transform our election data, which is structured by candidate-state-election, into a data set that contains the election results by state for 2020.\n\nUsing the code from this [slide](https://pols1600.paultesta.org/slides/05-slides.html#/q4.3-recode-presidential-data) transform `pres_df` to create a new data frame called `pres2020_df` by\n\n- Creating a copy of the year variable called `year_election`\n\n  - This is a stupid technical thing for merging later...\n\n- Taking the `state` variable which was `ALLCAPS` and turning into `Title Case` using the `str_to_title()` function\n\n- Changing the observations of `state` which are now `\"District Of Columbia\"` to `\"District Of Columbia\"`\n\n- Filtering the data to include only candidates from the Democratic and Republican Parties\n\n- Filtering the data to inlcude only the results from the 2020 election.\n\n- Selecting the `state`, `state_po`, `year_election`, `party_simplified`, `candidatevotes` and `totalvotes` columns from `pres_df`\n\n- Pivoting the `candidatevotes` into two new columns with names from the `party_simplified` column\n\n- Creating measures of the Democratic (`dem_voteshare`)and Republican (`rep_voteshare`) canditdates' vote shares in each state by dividing the new `DEMOCRAT` and `REPUBLICAN` columns by the values from the `totalvotes` column\n\n- Creating a variable called `winner` which takes a value of `\"Trump\"` if the `rep_voteshare` variable for a state is greater than the `dem_voteshare` for a state.\n\n- Making the `winner` variable a factor, with `Trump` as the first level and `Biden` as the second level\n\n  - This is a trick for `ggplot` so that if we want to use `winner` to color points on a scatter plot, the points for Trump observations will show up as red and the points for Biden observations will show as blue.\n\n- Saving the output of these transformations to an data frame called `pres2020_df`\n\nWhich, I know sounds like a lot, but...\n\n**All you need to do is copy and paste the code from this [slide](https://pols1600.paultesta.org/slides/05-slides.html#/q4.3-recode-presidential-data){target=\"_blank\"}.**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Transform Presidential Election data\n```\n:::\n\n\n# Merge the election data into the Covid-19 data\n\nNow that we've got our election data structured as electoral results per state, we can merge this state-level data into our Covid-19 data, using the common variable `state` in each data frame.\n\n- **In the code chunk below, use the `left_join()` command to merge the `pres2020_df` data into the `covid_us` data.**\n\nAgain, you should be able to just copy and paste the code from [here](https://pols1600.paultesta.org/slides/05-slides.html#/q5-merging-data){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Merge in Presidential Data\n```\n:::\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOk. That was a lot of code just to get the data set up to do some simple analyses[^1].\n\n[^1]: Which is why so much of the start of this course has been focused on developing our coding skills\n\nLet's start with some simple descriptive statistics.\n\n# Calculate the average number new Covid-19 deaths in Red and Blue States\n\n## For all the observations\n\nWith the `covid_us` data set:\n\n- use the `group_by()` command to have `summarise()` calculate values separately by the `winner` of each state.\n- use the `summarise()` command with `mean()` function to calculate the average number of new deaths (`new_deaths`) and the average of the 7-day rolling average of new deaths per 100,000 citizens (`new_deaths_pc_7day`)\n  - Remember to tell `mean()` what to do with NAs using the `na.rm` argument.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Calculate the mean number of new_deaths and new_deaths_pc_7day\n```\n:::\n\n\n## For the all the observations before April 19, 2021\n\nNow let's compare one of the **empirical implications** of Leonhardt's claims, specifically that \"Red Covid\" emerged as a phenomena because Republicans were less willing to take the vaccine.\n\nIf that's true, then the differences between Red and Blue states in terms of new deaths and new deaths per 100,000 residents should be smaller or reversed (i.e. more deaths in Blue states compared to Red States)\n\n- In the code chunk below, take the your code from the previous chunk, and use the `filter()` command to subset the data to include only obsevations with a value of `date` less than `\"2021-04-19`\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Calculate the mean number of new_deaths and new_deaths_pc_7day before April 19, 2021\n```\n:::\n\n\n## For the all the observations after April 19, 2021\n\nSimilarly, if Leonhardt's claim is true, then the differences between Red and Blue states should be more evident in the period after the vaccine became widely available.\n\n- In the code chunk below, take the your code from the previous chunk, and use the `filter()` command to subset the data to include only obsevations with a value of `date` greater than `\"2021-04-19`\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Calculate the mean number of new_deaths and new_deaths_pc_7day after April 19, 2021\n```\n:::\n\n\n- **Please interpret the results of this analysis here**\n\n- When we look at the difference in the average number of new deaths between Red and Blue States in the full dataset, we see that ...\n\n- However, when we consider differences in the 7-day average of new deaths per 100,000 residents, we see that ...\n\n- When we limit our analysis, to just observations before April 19, 2021 ...\n\n- When we look at observations after the vaccine became widely available ...\n\n# Calculate the average number new Covid-19 deaths in Red and Blue States using linear regression\n\nNow let's see how a linear model can be used to estimate conditional means.\n\nPlease estimate the following models using the `lm()` function:\n\n\\[ \\text{New Deaths} = \\beta\\_0 + \\beta\\_1 \\text{Election Winner} + \\epsilon \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{7-day average of New Deaths (per 100k)} = \\beta\\_0 + \\beta\\_1 \\text{Election Winner} + \\epsilon \\]\n\nSave the output of lm into objects called `m1` and `m2` and display the results of each model (by printing the objects on their own line)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Fit m1\n\n# Fit m2\n\n\n# Interpret model coefficients in terms of conditional means\n```\n:::\n\n\n- **Please interpret the coefficients of these models in terms of the conditional means you estimated for all the observations in the previous section**\n\n- The intercept corresponds to ...\n\n- The coefficient on winner corresponds to...\n\n- The intercept plus the coefficient corresponds to ...\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNeat. So this simple bivariate model with a binary predictor (a predictor that takes a value of 0 for states Trump won and 1 for states Biden won) is an example of a case where the conditional expectation function is identical to linear regression. As we will see below, for models with continous variables, linear regression provides a linear estimate of the conditional expectation function.\n\n# Explore the relationships between Republican vote share, vaccination rates, and deaths from Covid-19 on September 23, 2021\n\nLet's tease out some further implications Leonhardt's claim.\n\n- If vaccines are effective at reducing deaths from Covid-19, then the coefficient on $\\beta_1$ in the following model should be **PUT YOUR ANSWER HERE (NEGATIVE/POSITIVE)**\n\n\\[ \\text{m3} =\\text{14-day average of New Deaths (per 100k)} = \\beta\\_0 + \\beta\\_1 \\text{Percent Vaccinated} \\]\n\n- If Republicans are less likely to take the vaccine, then as the share of State's population that voted for Trump increases, we'd expect the percent of that state's population that is vaccinated to **PUT YOUR ANSWER HERE** and the so the coefficient on $\\beta_1$ in the following model should be **PUT YOUR ANSWER HERE**\n\n\\[ \\text{m4} =\\text{Percent Vaccinated} = \\beta\\_0 + \\beta\\_1 \\text{Republican Vote Share} \\]\n\n- Finally, if we find the expected relationships in models `m3` and `m4` above, we would expect the relationship between Trump's vote share new deaths from Covid-19 per 100,000 residents to be **PUT YOUR ANSWER HERE** in the following model:\n\n\\[ \\text{m5} =\\text{14-day average of New Deaths (per 100k)} = \\beta\\_0 + \\beta\\_1 \\text{Republican Vote Share} \\]\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow let's estimate these models!\n\nFor comparability, we will limit our analysis to just the observations from Sept 23, 2021, that Leonhardt used in his [article in the fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/27/briefing/covid-red-states-vaccinations.html) and use the 14-day average, rather than the 7-day average we've discussed so far, since that's what Leonhardt uses.\n\nIn the code chunk below, use `lm()` to estimate the relationship between:\n\n- Deaths modeled by percent vaccinated on 2021-09-23 (`new_deaths_pc_14day ~ percent_vaccinated`)\n\n- Percent vaccinated modeled by Republican Vote share on 2021-09-23 (`percent_vaccinated ~ ???`)\n\n- Deaths modeled by Republican vote share on 2021-09-23\n\nTo estimate these models using only data from September 23, 2021, place the following argument: `subset = date == \"2021-09-23\"` after the `data = covid_us` argument in `lm()` in each of your models.\n\nRemember to separate arguments in lm using a comma ( `lm(formula = ??? ~ ???, data = ???, subset = ??? == ???)`)\n\nPlease assign the output of each model to objects called `m3`, `m4`, and `m5`. Place these objects on their own line and interpret the results.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Deaths modeled by percent vaccinated on 2021-09-23\n\n\n#  Percent vaccinated modeled by Republican vote share on 2021-09-23\n\n\n# Deaths modeled by Republican vote share on 2021-09-23\n```\n:::\n\n\n- **Do your models' estimates match your expectations?** That is do the coefficients on each of the predictors have the expected sign (positive or negative), that you wrote above?

Have fun with it, but don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good enough.\n\n![](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/018/899/936.jpg)\n\n**When you're finished exploring, please write the code for your new and improved `fig_m5` in the code chunk below**\n\nHere's an example fo what an improved `fig_m5` might look like\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Updated fig_m5 code here\n```\n:::\n\n\nIn the comments to this lab, I'll include some code to recreate as closely as possible, the first two figures from Leonhardt's September 27, 2021 [article.](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/27/briefing/covid-red-states-vaccinations.html)\n\n# Alternative explanations for Red Covid\n\nFinally, let's consider some alternative explanations for why we might see an association between state partisanship and Covid-19 outcomes.\n\nThink about factors that might be associated with both Covid-19 deaths and a state's Republican voteshare\n\n**Please write some alternative explanations for why we might see a relationship between the Republican Vote Share in a State and Covid-19 outcomes**\n\n- Alternative Explanation 1\n- Alternative Explanation 2\n- ...\n- Write as many as you want!\n\nIf you're stumped, Leonhardt discusses some of these explanations in his November 2021 [article](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/08/briefing/covid-death-toll-red-america.html){target=\"_blank\"} on the matter.\n\n# Take the Class Survey\n\nIf you've got a moment please take a few moments to complete the [class survey](https://brown.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bDFDWRGcnpm09hk){target=\"_blank\"} for this week.\n",
