Then we will explore **whether the intervention had any effect on respondents' feelings toward transgender individuals.**\n\nTo accomplish this we will:\n\n1.  Summarize the study (5 Minutes)\n2.  Set up our work space (2-3 Minutes)\n3.  Load a portion of the replication data (1-2 Minutes)\n4.  Get a high level overview of the data (5 minutes)\n5.  Describe the distribution of covariates in the full dataset (5 minutes)\n6.  Examine the difference in covariates between those who did and did not complete the survey (10 minutes)\n7.  Examine the difference in covariates between those assigned to each treatment condition in the study. (10 minutes)\n8.  Estimate the average treatment effect of the intervention (10 minutes)\n9.  Plot the results and comment on the study (10 minutes)\n10. Take the weekly survey (3-5 minutes)\n\nOne of these 9 tasks (excluding the weekly survey) will be randomly selected as the graded question for the lab.\n\nYou will work in your assigned groups. Only one member of each group needs to submit the html file of lab.\n\nThis lab **must** contain the names of the group members in attendance.\n\nIf you are attending remotely, you will submit your labs individually.\n\nHere are your assigned groups for the semester.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n\n```\nError in `tibble::tibble()`:\n!

We will use these means to\n\n-   **Describe the characteristics of the study's population.** After Question 5, you should be able to describe what a typical registered voter in Miami-Dade County looks like\n-   **Explore differences between participants in the study this population** Do people who took the baseline survey differ in systematic ways from people who did not (Question 6)\n-   **Assess the empirical implications of the identifying assumptions of this design** If treatment was randomly assigned, then participants assigned to treatment condition should on average look similar to participants in the control condition (Question 7)\n-   **Estimate the average treatment effect over multiple time periods** You'll recall from lecture that the ATE is simply a difference of conditional means:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nE \\left[ \\frac{\\sum_1^m Y_i}{m}-\\frac{\\sum_{m+1}^N Y_i}{N-m}\\right]&=\\overbrace{E \\left[ \\frac{\\sum_1^m Y_i}{m}\\right]}^{\\substack{\\text{Average outcome}\\\\\n\\text{among treated}\\\\ \\text{units}}}\n-\\overbrace{E \\left[\\frac{\\sum_{m+1}^N Y_i}{N-m}\\right]}^{\\substack{\\text{Average outcome}\\\\\n\\text{among control}\\\\ \\text{units}}}\\\\\n&= E [Y_i(1)|D_i=1] -E[Y_i(0)|D_i=0]\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nWe'll see that these quantities can be calculated quickly for multiple variables using the following commands:\n\n-   We will use the `group_by` and `summarise` commands to quickly calculate average values for different groups, and the `mutate` function to calculate differences between these averages\n-   We will introduce the `across()` and `starts_with()` functions to calculate summaries like a `mean` across multiple variables that start the the same pre-fixes.\n-   We will introduce the `pivot_longer()`, `pivot_wider()` and `left_join` commands to gather, spread, and merge data so that we can calculate the difference of means simply by subtracting means for one group in one column from means for another group in a different column\n-   We will use functions from the `ggplot` package to graphically display our results.\n\n# Please knit this .Rmd file {.unnumbered}\n\nAs with every lab, you should:\n\n-   Download the file\n-   Save it in your course folder\n-   **Update the `author:` section of the YAML header to include the names of your group members in attendance.**\n-   Knit the document\n-   Open the html file in your browser (Easier to read)\n-   Knit the document again after completing a section or chunk (Error checking)\n-   Upload the final lab to \\[Canvas\\]https://canvas.brown.edu/courses/1091286/assignments/7925686?module_item_id=10882030){target=\"\\_blank\"}.\n\n# Summarize the study\n\nBefore we get started working with the data, please provide some brief answers (1-3 sentences) to the following questions\n\n-   **What's the research question?**\n-   **What's the theoretical framework?**\n-   **What's the empirical design?**\n-   **What's are the main results?**\n\n# Set up your workspace\n\nHere is some minimal code so that your lab will compile when you first knit it.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.4\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.4.4     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.0\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (<http://conflicted.r-lib.org/>) to force all conflicts to become errors\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n1.  **In the code chunk below, please set up your work space by loading more packages, following the steps outlined in the slides [here](https://pols1600.paultesta.org/slides/03-slides.html#14){target=\"_blank\"}**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Load the replication data\n\nNext we'll load the data for today, which is a subset of Broockman and Kalla's full data set[^1]\n\n[^1]: You can find the full set of replication files [here](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/WKR39N){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n1.  **Please run the code chunk below to load the data** That's it.
