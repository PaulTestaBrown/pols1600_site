Lower rates of vaccination among Republicans have in turn led to higher rates of death from Covid-19 in Red States compared to Blue States.\n\nIn this lab, we'll reproduce some basic evidence of this phenomena, using bivariate linear regression as a tool to summarize and describe relationships.\n\nNext week, we'll see how multiple regression (linear regression with multiple predictors) can be used to assess alternative explanations for the patterns we see.\n\nTo accomplish this we will:\n\n1.  Set up our work space (2-3 Minutes)\n\n2.  Load data on Covid-19 and the 2020 Election. (5 Minutes)\n\n3.  Describe the structure of these two datasets (5 Minutes)\n\n4.  Transform the datasets so we can analyze them (10 minutes)\n\n5.  Merge the election data into our Covid-19 data (5 minues)\n\n6.  Calculate the average number new Covid-19 deaths in Red and Blue States (5 minutes)\n\n7.  Calculate the average number new Covid-19 deaths in Red and B Blue States using linear regression (10 minutes)\n\n8.  Explore the relationships between Republican vote share, vaccination rates, and deaths from Covid-19 on September 23, 2021 (10 minutes)\n\n9.  Visualize the relationships between Republican vote share, vaccination rates, and deaths from Covid-19 on September 23, 2021 (15-20 minutes)\n\n10. Discuss some alternative explanations for these relationships (5-10 minutes)\n\n11. Take the weekly survey (2-3 minutes)\n\nOne of these 10 tasks (excluding the weekly survey) will be randomly selected as the graded question for the lab.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(3032022)\ngraded_question <- sample(1:10,size = 1)\npaste(\"Question\",graded_question,\"is the graded question for this week\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"Question 9 is the graded question for this week\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n> Grading Questin 9: Basically, if you made any changes to `fig_m5` 100 percent.

But don't fret, remember your 3 lowest lab scores are dropped from your lab grade.\n\nYou will work in your assigned groups. Only one member of each group needs to submit the html file of lab.\n\nThis lab **must** contain the names of the group members in attendance.\n\nIf you are attending remotely, you will submit your labs individually.\n\nHere are your assigned groups for the semester.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n\n```\nError in `tibble::tibble()`:\n!

In particular, you will get practice:\n\n  - Creating and recoding variables using `mutate()`\n  - Calculating a [moving average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average) or rolling mean using the `rollmean()` function from the `zoo` package\n  - Transforming the data on presidential elections so that it can be merged with the data on Covid-19 using the `pivot_wider()` function.\n  - [Merging data](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html) together using the `left_join()` function.\n\n- In question 6, you will see how calculating conditional means provides a simple test of \"Red Covid\" claim.\n\n- In question 7, you will see how a linear model returns the same information as these conditional means (in a sligthly different format)\n\n- In question 8, you will get practice interpreting linear models with continuous predictors (i.e. predictors that take on a range of values)\n\n- In question 9, you will get practice visualizing these models and using the figures help interpret your results substantively.\n\n- Question 10 asks you to play the role of a skeptic, and consider what other factors might explain the relationships we found in Questions 6-9. We will explore these factors in next week's lab.\n\n# Please knit this .Rmd file {.unnumbered}\n\nAs with every lab, you should:\n\n- Download the file\n- Save it in your course folder\n- **Update the `author:` section of the YAML header to include the names of your group members in attendance.**\n- Knit the document\n- Open the html file in your browser (Easier to read)\n- Knit the document again after completing a section or chunk (Error checking)\n- Upload the final lab to [Canvas](https://canvas.brown.edu/courses/1087979/assignments/7870523?module_item_id=10762397){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\n# Set up your workspace\n\n1.  **In the code chunk below, please set up your work space by loading more packages, using the [code from slides 9-11 from Tuesday's class](https://pols1600.paultesta.org/slides/05-slides.html#9){target=\"_blank\"}**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Set working directory\nwd <- \".\" # Change to file path on your computer\nsetwd(wd)\n\nthe_packages <- c(\n  ## R Markdown\n  \"kableExtra\",\"DT\",\"texreg\",\n  ## Tidyverse\n  \"tidyverse\", \"lubridate\", \"forcats\", \"haven\", \"labelled\",\n  ## Extensions for ggplot\n  \"ggmap\",\"ggrepel\", \"ggridges\", \"ggthemes\", \"ggpubr\", \n  \"GGally\", \"scales\", \"dagitty\", \"ggdag\", \"ggforce\",\n  # Data \n  \"COVID19\",\"maps\",\"mapdata\",\"qss\",\"tidycensus\", \"dataverse\",\n  # Analysis\n  \"DeclareDesign\", \"easystats\", \"zoo\"\n)\n\n# Define function to load packages\nipak <- function(pkg){\n    new.pkg <- pkg[!(pkg %in% installed.packages()[, \"Package\"])]\n    if (length(new.pkg)) \n        install.packages(new.pkg, dependencies = TRUE)\n    sapply(pkg, require, character.only = TRUE)\n}\n\nipak(the_packages)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n   kableExtra            DT        texreg     tidyverse     lubridate \n         TRUE          TRUE          TRUE          TRUE          TRUE \n      forcats         haven      labelled         ggmap       ggrepel \n         TRUE          TRUE          TRUE          TRUE          TRUE \n     ggridges      ggthemes        ggpubr        GGally        scales \n         TRUE          TRUE          TRUE          TRUE          TRUE \n      dagitty         ggdag       ggforce       COVID19          maps \n         TRUE          TRUE          TRUE          TRUE          TRUE \n      mapdata           qss    tidycensus     dataverse DeclareDesign \n         TRUE          TRUE          TRUE          TRUE          TRUE \n    easystats           zoo \n         TRUE          TRUE \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Load the data for today.\n\nNext we'll load data to explore the phenomenom of *Red Covid*\n\n## Load Covid-19 data\n\nFirst we'll need data on Covid-19 cases and deaths that we've worked with throughout the course.\n\n**In the chunk below, please write code to load data on Covid-19 in the states using the `covid19()` function from the `COVID19` package.

Substantively, what do rows in `covid` and `pres_df` correspond to?**\n\n- A row in the `covid` dataset corresponds roughly to an observation of given state (or US Territory) on a given date. For example, the first row in `covid` describes the state of Covid-19 in the Northern Mariana Islands on March 16, 2020.\n\n- A row in the `pres_df` dataset corresponds to a candidate's results in a given state in a given presidential election. For example, the first row describes the number of votes Jimmy Carter got in Alabama in 1976.\n\nYou may want to use the code chunk below to get a quick high-level overview of the data\n\n\n:::

This difference reflects the fact that Biden tended to win more populous states than trump, so simply looking at the average number of new deaths is bit misleading. Comparing 7-day averages per 100,000 residents adjusts for differences in population between Red and Blue States.\n\n- When we limit our analysis, to just observations before April 19, 2021, the difference in the 7-day average rate of new Covid-19 deaths per 100,000 residents is relatively small (0.02 more deaths per 100,000 residents in Red States)\n\n- When we look at observations after the vaccine became widely available the difference is more than 6 times as big (0.125 more deaths per 100,000 residents in Red States)\n\n# Calculate the average number new Covid-19 deaths in Red and Blue States using linear regression\n\nNow let's see how a linear model can be used to estimate conditional means.\n\nPlease estimate the following models using the `lm()` function:\n\n\\[ \\text{New Deaths} = \\beta\\_0 + \\beta\\_1 \\text{Election Winner} + \\epsilon \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{7-day average of New Deaths (per 100k)} = \\beta\\_0 + \\beta\\_1 \\text{Election Winner} + \\epsilon \\]\n\nSave the output of lm into objects called `m1` and `m2` and display the results of each model (by printing the objects on their own line)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nm1 <- lm(new_deaths ~ winner, covid_us)\nm2 <- lm(new_deaths_pc_7day ~ winner, covid_us)\n\n# Intercept corresponds to the mean among Red States\ncoef(m1)[1]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n(Intercept) \n   19.34867 \n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmean(covid_us$new_deaths[covid_us$winner == \"Trump\"], na.rm=T)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 19.34867\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Slope corresponds to the difference in means between Red and Blue States\ncoef(m1)[1] + coef(m1)[2]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n(Intercept) \n   22.04853 \n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmean(covid_us$new_deaths[covid_us$winner == \"Biden\"], na.rm=T)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 22.04853\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Intercept corresponds to the mean among Red States\ncoef(m2)[1]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n(Intercept) \n  0.3402479 \n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmean(covid_us$new_deaths_pc_7day[covid_us$winner == \"Trump\"], na.rm=T)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0.3402479\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Slope corresponds to the difference in means between Red and Blue States\ncoef(m2)[1] + coef(m2)[2]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n(Intercept) \n  0.2871843 \n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmean(covid_us$new_deaths_pc_7day[covid_us$winner == \"Biden\"], na.rm=T)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0.2871843\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n- **Please interpret the coefficients of these models in terms of the conditional means you estimated for all the observations in the previous section**\n\n- The intercept corresponds to the mean number of new deaths (`m1`)/new deaths per 100k (`m2`) in states Trump won\n\n- The coefficient on winner corresponds to the difference in means between Red and Blue states.\n\n- The intercept plus the coefficient corresponds to the mean number of new deaths (`m1`)/new deaths per 100k (`m2`) in states Biden won\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNeat. So this simple bivariate model with a binary predictor (a predictor that takes a value of 0 for states Trump won and 1 for states Biden won) is an example of a case where the conditional expectation function is identical to linear regression. As we will see below, for models with continous variables, linear regression provides a linear estimate of the conditional expectation function.\n\n# Explore the relationships between Republican Vote Share, Vaccination Rates, and Deaths from Covid-19 on September 23, 2021\n\nLet's tease out some further implications Leonhardt's claim.\n\n- If vaccines are effective at reducing deaths from Covid-19, then the coefficient on $\\beta_1$ in the following model should be **PUT YOUR ANSWER HERE (NEGATIVE/POSITIVE)**\n\n\\[ \\text{m3} =\\text{14-day average of New Deaths (per 100k)} = \\beta\\_0 + \\beta\\_1 \\text{Percent Vaccinated} \\]\n\n- If Republicans are less likely to take the vaccine, then as the share of State's population that voted for Trump increases, we'd expect the percent of that state's population that is vaccinated to **PUT YOUR ANSWER HERE** and the so the coefficient on $\\beta_1$ in the following model should be **PUT YOUR ANSWER HERE**\n\n\\[ \\text{m4} =\\text{Percent Vaccinated} = \\beta\\_0 + \\beta\\_1 \\text{Republican Vote Share} \\]\n\n- Finally, if we find the expected relationships in models `m3` and `m4` above, we would expect the relationship between Trump's vote share new deaths from Covid-19 per 100,000 residents to be **PUT YOUR ANSWER HERE** in the following model:\n\n\\[ \\text{m5} =\\text{14-day average of New Deaths (per 100k)} = \\beta\\_0 + \\beta\\_1 \\text{Republican Vote Share} \\]\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow let's estimate these models!\n\nFor comparability, we will limit our analysis to just the observations from Sept 23, 2021, that Leonhardt used in his [article in the fall](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/27/briefing/covid-red-states-vaccinations.html) and use the 14-day average, rather than the 7-day average we've discussed so far, since that's what Leonhardt uses.\n\nIn the code chunk below, use `lm()` to estimate the relationship between:\n\n- Deaths modeled by percent vaccinated on 2021-09-23 (`new_deaths_pc_14day ~ percent_vaccinated`)\n\n- Percent vaccinated modeled by Republican Vote share on 2021-09-23 (`percent_vaccinated ~ ???`)\n\n- Deaths modeled by Republican vote share on 2021-09-23\n\nTo estimate these models using only data from September 23, 2021, place the following argument: `subset = date == \"2021-09-23\"` after the `data = covid_us` argument in `lm()` in each of your models.\n\nRemember to separate arguments in lm using a comma ( `lm(formula = ??? ~ ???, data = ???, subset = ??? == ???)`)\n\nPlease assign the output of each model to objects called `m3`, `m4`, and `m5`.

But as Leonhardt argues, shouldn't we have seen a difference throughout Covid then? Similary, Red states tend to be poorer, maybe there residents are on average less healthy,\n\n- Geography and Climate\n\n- Different policies\n\n  - Different policy regimes and rates of compliance with social distancing measures (this is still a partisan story the mechanism is maybe different than a simple low rates of vaccines)\n\nAnyway there are lots of things a skeptic might claim. Next week, we'll see how we might explore these criticisms using multiple regression.\n\n# Take the Class Survey\n\nPlease take a few moments to complete the [class survey](https://brown.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bDFDWRGcnpm09hk){target=\"_blank\"} for this week.\n",
