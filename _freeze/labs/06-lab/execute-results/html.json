Lower rates of vaccination among Republicans have in turn led to higher rates of death from Covid-19 in Red States compared to Blue States.\n\nA skeptic of this claim might argue that relationship between electoral and epidemelogical outcomes is *spurious*, saying somthing like:\n\n> There are lots of ways that Red States differ from Blue States --- demographics, economics, geography, culture, and so on -- and it is these differences that explain the phenomena of Red Covid. If we were to control for these *omitted variables* the relationship between a state's partisan leanings and Covid-19 would go away.\n\nIn this lab, we will see how we can explore these claims using **multiple regression** to **control** for competing explanations.\n\nTo accomplish this we will:\n\n1.  Get set up to work (10 minutes)\n\nThen we will estimate and interpret a series of regression models:\n\n2.  A baseline Red Covid model using simple bivariate regression using the `Republican vote share` of states to predict the 14-day average of per capita `Covid-19 deaths` on September 23, 2021 (10 Minutes)\n\n3.  A multiple regression model controlling for `Republican vote share` the `median age` (15 minutes)\n\n4.  A model controlling for `Republican vote share`, the `median age` **and** `median income` (15 minutes)\n\n5.  A model controlling for `Republican vote share`, the `median age` `median income` **and** `vaccination rates` (15 minutes)\n\n6.  A model using `Republican vote share`, the `median age` `median income` to predict `vaccination rates` (15 minutes)\n\nFinally, we'll take the weekly survey which will serve as a mid semester check in.\n\nOne of these 6 tasks (excluding the weekly survey) will be randomly selected as the graded question for the lab.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(3092022)\ngraded_question <- sample(1:10,size = 1)\npaste(\"Question\",graded_question,\"is the graded question for this week\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"Question 6 is the graded question for this week\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nYou will work in your assigned groups.

As the predictor increases does the outcome tend to increase (positive) or decrease (negative)\n-   **Size** is the change in the predicted value of the outcome **substantively** meaningful?\n    -   To facilitate comparisons between predictors, we will use [standardized measures](https://pols1600.paultesta.org/slides/06-slides.html#29){target=\"_blank\"} of Republican Vote Share, Median Age, and Median Income, and Percent Vaccinated\n-   **Significance** today we'll put the cart before the horse, and say, coefficient that has one or more asterisks `*` next to it is *statistically significant*\n    -   Over the next several weeks, we'll talk in great detail the logic and theory behind statistical inference\n    -   For today, we'll do a bit of \"star-gazing\" using these asterisks[^1] as heuristics to help us evaluate the claims of Leonhardt and his skeptics.\n\n[^1]: In short, these `*` correspond to $p-values$ below different thresholds. One `*` typically means $p < 0.05$. A p-value is a conditional probability that arises from a hypothesis test summarizing the likelihood of observing a particular test statistic (here a regression coefficient, or more specifically, a t-statistic which is the regression coefficient divided by its standard error) given a paritcular hypothesis (typically, but not allows a *null hypothesis* that the true coefficient is 0). In sum, a p-value assess the likelihood of seeing what we did, if in fact, there was no relationship. If that likelihood is small (p\\<0.05), we reject the claim of no relationship. We remain uncertain about the true value of the coefficient, but we are pretty confident it's not 0.\n\n# Workflow {.unnumbered}\n\n# Please knit this .Rmd file {.unnumbered}\n\nAs with every lab, you should:\n\n-   Download the file\n-   Save it in your course folder\n-   **Update the `author:` section of the YAML header to include the names of your group members in attendance.**\n-   Knit the document\n-   Open the html file in your browser (Easier to read)\n-   Write yourcode in the chunks provided\n-   Comment out or delete any test code you do not need\n-   **Knit the document again after completing a section or chunk** (Error checking)\n-   Upload the final lab to [Canvas](https://canvas.brown.edu/courses/1091286/modules/items/10882045){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\n# Get setup to work\n\n## Load Packages\n\nFirst lets load the libraries we'll need for today.\n\nThere's one new package, `htmltools` which we'll use to display regression tables while we work.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nthe_packages <- c(\n  ## R Markdown\n  \"kableExtra\",\"DT\",\"texreg\",\"htmltools\",\n  ## Tidyverse\n  \"tidyverse\", \"lubridate\", \"forcats\", \"haven\", \"labelled\",\n  ## Extensions for ggplot\n  \"ggmap\",\"ggrepel\", \"ggridges\", \"ggthemes\", \"ggpubr\", \n  \"GGally\", \"scales\", \"dagitty\", \"ggdag\", \"ggforce\",\n  # Data \n  \"COVID19\",\"maps\",\"mapdata\",\"qss\",\"tidycensus\", \"dataverse\",\n  # Analysis\n  \"DeclareDesign\", \"easystats\", \"zoo\"\n)\n\n# Define function to load packages\nipak <- function(pkg){\n    new.pkg <- pkg[!(pkg %in% installed.packages()[, \"Package\"])]\n    if (length(new.pkg)) \n        install.packages(new.pkg, dependencies = TRUE)\n    sapply(pkg, require, character.only = TRUE)\n}\n\nipak(the_packages)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n   kableExtra            DT        texreg     htmltools     tidyverse \n         TRUE          TRUE          TRUE          TRUE          TRUE \n    lubridate       forcats         haven      labelled         ggmap \n         TRUE          TRUE          TRUE          TRUE          TRUE \n      ggrepel      ggridges      ggthemes        ggpubr        GGally \n         TRUE          TRUE          TRUE          TRUE          TRUE \n       scales       dagitty         ggdag       ggforce       COVID19 \n         TRUE          TRUE          TRUE          TRUE          TRUE \n         maps       mapdata           qss    tidycensus     dataverse \n         TRUE          TRUE          TRUE          TRUE          TRUE \nDeclareDesign     easystats           zoo \n         TRUE          TRUE          TRUE \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Load the data\n\nNext we'll load the data that we created in class on Tuesday which provides a snapshot of the state of Covid-19 on September 23, 2021 in the U.S.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nload(url(\"https://pols1600.paultesta.org/files/data/06_lab.rda\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\nAfter running this code, the data frame `covid_lab` should appear in your environment pane in R Studio\n\n## Describe the data\n\nIn the code chunk below, please write some code get an high level overview of the data:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# High level overview\n# Number of observations and variables\n\n\n# Names of variables\n\n\n# Glimpse of data\n\n\n# Summary of data\n\n\n# Calculate standard deviations\n```\n:::\n\n\nPlease use this HLO to answer the following questions:\n\n-   **How many observations are there:**\n\n-   **What is an observation (i.e. what is the unit of analysis):**\n\n-   **What is the primary outcome variable for today:**\n\n-   **What are the four main predictors we'll be using:**\n\n-   **Will we be using the the raw values of these predictors or their standardized values?**\n\n-   **What is the standard deviation of our outcome and predictor variables:**\n\n    -

This is model's prediction for a state where Trump got 0 percent of the vote. This is typically not something we care about.\n\n-   $\\beta_1$ corresponds to the slope. Because we used a standardized measure of vote share, we would say that a 1-standard deviation (about 10 percentage points) increase in Republican vote share is associated with a 0.23 increase the average number of new Covid-19 deaths. Given that this per-capita measure has a standard deviation of 0.4, this is a fairly sizable association.\n\n-   Finally, note that last column of `summary(m1)` `Pr(>|t|)` both the coefficients for the intercept $(\\beta_0)$ and `rep_voteshare_std` ($(\\beta_1)$) are **statistically significant** (ie have an `*` next to them).\n\n## Display the model as a regression table\n\nNext we'll format the results of `summary(m1)` into a **regression table** using the `htmlreg()` function.\n\nRegression tables are a the standard way of concisely presenting the results of regression models.\n\n-   Each named row corresponds to the coefficients form the model\n\n-   If there is an asterisks next to a coefficient, that coefficient is **statistically significant** with a p value below a certain threshold.\n\n-   The numbers in parentheses below each coefficient correspond to the **standard error** of the coefficient (more on that later)[^2]\n\n-   The bottom of the table contains summary statistics of of our model, which we'll ignore for today.\n\n[^2]: A standard error is another one of those things that in the cart we're putting before horse today. Briefly, it is an estimate of the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of a coefficient and describes how much our coefficient might vary had we had a different sample...\n\nThe code after `htmlreg(m1)` allows you to see what output of the table will look like in the html document while you're working in the Rmd file.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n```{=html}\n<table class=\"texreg\" style=\"margin: 10px auto;border-collapse: collapse;border-spacing: 0px;caption-side: bottom;color: #000000;border-top: 2px solid #000000;\">\n<caption>Statistical models</caption>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"padding-left: 5px;padding-right: 5px;\">&nbsp;</th>\n<th style=\"padding-left: 5px;padding-right: 5px;\">Model 1</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"border-top: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<td style=\"padding-left: 5px;padding-right: 5px;\">(Intercept)</td>\n<td style=\"padding-left: 5px;padding-right: 5px;\">0.58<sup>&#42;&#42;&#42;</sup></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding-left: 5px;padding-right: 5px;\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td style=\"padding-left: 5px;padding-right: 5px;\">(0.05)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding-left: 5px;padding-right: 5px;\">rep_voteshare_std</td>\n<td style=\"padding-left: 5px;padding-right: 5px;\">0.23<sup>&#42;&#42;&#42;</sup></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding-left: 5px;padding-right: 5px;\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td style=\"padding-left: 5px;padding-right: 5px;\">(0.05)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"border-top: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<td style=\"padding-left: 5px;padding-right: 5px;\">R<sup>2</sup></td>\n<td style=\"padding-left: 5px;padding-right: 5px;\">0.31</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding-left: 5px;padding-right: 5px;\">Adj.

For ease of interpretation, let's use the unstandardized measure of vaccination rates, `percent_vaccinated` as our outcome variable.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# m5\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Summarize the results\n\nAnd summarize the results\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# summary of m5\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Display the results in a regression table\n\nDisplay them in a regression table\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Interpret the results\n\n**Summarize the results of `m5` and offer some broader discussion of what we've learned today**\n\n# Take the Class Survey {.unnumbered}\n\nPlease take a few moments to complete the [class survey](https://brown.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6mUeyI7tqVURHQW){target=\"_blank\"} for this week.\n",
