We will use the daily data from the Intrade betting market to derive probabilities from degenerate gamblers about the likelihood that Obama would win the 2008 presidential election. We will use these probabilities to simulate possible elections and the summarize outcomes of these simulations graphically.\n\nPlan to spend the following amount of time\n\n1.  Get set up to work (5 minutes)\n\n2.  Calculate Obama's expected electoral vote share on November 3, 2008 (the day before the election) (10 minutes)\n\n3.  Simulate a 1000 elections for November 3, 2008 using the betting market prices a measure of the probability that Obama wins or loses a state (10 minutes)\n\n4.  Display the results of your simulation with a histogram. (5 minutes)\n\n5.  Transform these probabilities to reduce the likelihood that Obama wins states like Alabama and increase the likelihood that Obama wins states like California (5 minutes)\n\n6.  Simulate another 1000 elections using these transformed probabilities. Compare the results to your initial simulation. (10)\n\n7.  Calculate Obama's expected total number of votes for each day in the 120 days before the 2008 election (15 minutes)\n\n8.  Simulate 100 elections for each of the 120 days before the election, plot the results of your simulation. (20 minutes)\n\n## Goals {.unnumbered}\n\nConceptually, the main goals of this lab are to\n\n-   give you some practice working with probabilities in an application to the real world (predicting elections)\n\n-   introduce the idea of simulations as a tool for understanding probability and describing our uncertainty about what could have happened\n\nTechnically, you learn how to\n\n-   use `for()` loops, which a useful programming skill when you need to do something repeatedly\n\n-   work with `R`'s built in probability functions. Specifically, we'll use the:\n\n    -   `rbernoulli()` function to simulate \"coin flips\" for each state and on each date, will the betting market data will define the probability that Obama wins that state.\n    -   `pnorm()` and `qnorm()` functions to transform these probabilities, giving more probability to places where Obama is likely to win, and less probability to states Obama is unlikely to win.\n\n-   You'll also get practice wrangling and visualizing data (today using R's base graphics functions)\n\n## Workflow {.unnumbered}\n\n### Please knit this .Rmd file {.unnumbered}\n\nAs with every lab, you should:\n\n-   Download the file\n-   Save it in your course folder\n-   **Update the `author:` section of the YAML header to include the names of your group members in attendance.**\n-   Knit the document\n-   Open the html file in your browser (Easier to read)\n-   Write yourcode in the chunks provided\n-   Comment out or delete any test code you do not need\n-   **Knit the document again after completing a section or chunk** (Error checking)\n-   Upload the final lab to [Canvas](https://canvas.brown.edu/courses/1087979/assignments/7870531?module_item_id=10762404){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\n# Get setup to work\n\n## Load Packages\n\nFirst we'll load the pacakges we need for today:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(qss)\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow we'll load two data sets from the `qss` package: `pres08` and `intrade08`\n\n-   `pres08` contains the 2008 US presidential election outcomes by state.\n-   `intrade08` contains from Intrade, an online prediction market, in days leading up to the 2008 United States Presidential Election.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Results from 2008 election\ndata(\"pres08\")\n\n# Daily betting market data\ndata(\"intrade08\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Provide a high level overview each data set\n\nIn the code chunk below, please write some code to provide a high level overview of each data set.\n\nWe will primarily work with the `EV` variable from `pres08` which contains the electoral votes for each state, and the `PriceD` variable from `intrade08` from which we will construct a probability that Obama wins that state.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# HLO\n# pres08\n\n# intrade08\n```\n:::\n\n\n**Briefly describe each data set**\n\n-   The `pres08` data set contain ...\n\n-   The `intrade08` data contain ...\n\n## Re-Arrange the Intrade\n\nIf you look closely at the data, you'd see that both are arranged alphabetically by state name, but in the `pres08` data, the District of Columbia is named \"D.C.\", while in the `intrade08` data it is called \"District of Columbia\".\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npres08$state.name[8]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"D.C.\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nintrade08$statename[9]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"District of Columbia\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAs a result, D.C. comes before Delaware in `pres08` but after Delaware in `intrade08`.

Please create a variable called `prob_obama_win` in `intrade08` by dividing `PriceD` by 100.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Create variable prob_obama_win from PriceD in intrade08\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Create a subset of intrade08, called `df_nov3`\n\nNext we'll create a subset of the data, called `df_nov3` that contains just the data from the day before the election (that is Monday, November 3, 2008)\n\n-   Hint: try `filter()`\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# create df_nov3\n```\n:::\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Calculate Obama's expected electoral votes on November 3, 2008\n\nUsing the data from `pres08` and `df_nov3`, calculate the expected number of electoral votes Obama is predicted to win in the Intrade data by summing up the states where `prob_obama_win` is greater than 0.5\n\nHints:\n\n-   Because `pres08` and `df_nov3` have the same number of rows, and the rows are ordered in the same way (alphabetically by postal abbreviation), we can select variables from `pres08` using a logical index (`[]`) on variables from `df_nov3`\n\n-   The you can just sum up the `EV` where `prob_obama_win` is greater than 0.5\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Calculate expected Obama EV using prob_obama win \n```\n:::\n\n\n**Please fill in the `???` below:**\n\nUsing the Intrade data from November 3, 2008, Obama is expected to win **???** electoral votes\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo it looks like the betting markets are pretty good. From the previous question, we saw that the Intrade data for November 3, 2008 predicted Obama will win 364 votes, which taking into account the fact that Nebraska divides its electoral votes, is pretty close to the 365 he actually won\n\n# Use the probabilities from the day before the election to simulate the total number of electoral votes Obama is predicted to win.\n\nNow let's use the probabilities from `prob_obama_win` in `df_nov3` to simulate an the idea of running repeated elections.\n\nOur variable `prob_obama_win` represents a probability that Obama win's a given state. It's relatively low for a Red state like Alabama, high for blue state like California and more uncertain for a swing state like North Carolina\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Prob(Obama Win on Nov 3, 2008)\ndf_nov3$prob_obama_win[df_nov3$state == \"AL\"]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n\n```\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'df_nov3' not found\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf_nov3$prob_obama_win[df_nov3$state == \"NC\"]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n\n```\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'df_nov3' not found\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf_nov3$prob_obama_win[df_nov3$state == \"CA\"]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n\n```\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'df_nov3' not found\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTo simulate the outcome of the election, we'll treat whether Obama won as the result of a [Bernoulli trial](https://pols1600.paultesta.org/slides/08-slides.html#92){target=\"_blank\"} where the probability of success (Obama winning) is $p_{ij}$ (that is, the value of `prob_obama_win`) for each state.\n\nIn most of these simulations, Obama will lose Alabama and win California. However, in each simulation, these probabilities suggest there's a chance he wins Alabama (3 percent) or loses California (2 percent)[^1]\n\n[^1]: Here we're assuming these probabilities are independent. Actual forecasting models like 538 or the NYT generally assume the probabilities of winning some states correlate with the probability of winning other neighboring states.\n\nTo simulate repeated elections, we'll do the following:\n\n-   set the random seed using `set.seed(123)` (This makes random simulations reproducible)\n\n-   define `sims` the number of simulations we want to to do. Let's set `sims` equal to 1,000\n\n-   define the number of states as `n_states` in our simulation, which corresponds to the number of *Bernoulli trials* (coinflips)\n\n-   define the probability `p_obama_win` (probability of Obama winning) corresponding to `prob_obama_win` in `df_nov3` for each state.\n\n-   create an *empty* vector called `obama_ev_1` to store the results of each simulation\n\n-   use a `for()` loop to simulate these hypothetical elections, where for each `i` in 1 to `sims`,\n\n    -   we take a random draw of size n (equal to the number of states) with corresponding probabilities `p` (equal to `prob_obama_win`) using `rbernoulli`\n    -   use the outcome of this random draw (a series of 0s and 1s of length `n_states`) to select the electoral votes for the states Obama one in simulation `i`\n    -   sum up the electoral votes for states Obama one in simulation `i` and save them to `obama_ev_1[i]`\n\nI've written some code to get you started in the code chunk below.\n\nPlease **uncomment the code** and replace the `???` with the correct values.\n\nWe'll interpret the results of our simulation in the next question.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## Set random seed\n# set.seed(123)\n#\n## Define number of simulations\n# sims <- ?????\n#\n## Define number of states for each simulation\n# n_states <- ?????\n#\n## Create empty container for results of simulation\n# obama_ev_1 <- c() \n#\n## Use for loop to conduct simulations\n#\n# for(i in 1:1000){\n#   obama_ev_1[i] <- sum(\n#     pres08$EV[rbernoulli(\n#       n = ???, \n#       p = ???)\n#       ]\n#     )\n# }\n```\n:::\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Display the distribution of predicted number of electoral votes in a histogram\n\nPlease do the following with `obama_ev_1`\n\n-   use the `hist()` function to create a histogram\n\n-   use the `abline()` function to plot a vertical line at 365\n\n    -   try running `?graphics::abline` to see the help page for `abline()` to see how to draw a vertical line on a plot\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# histogram of simulated EV\n\n# vertical line showing actual votes\n```\n:::\n\n\n**Answer:** Write your interpretation of the histogram here.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nInteresting. So the typical electoral vote share from the simulations is a bit lower than Obama's actual vote share and in a small number of simulations, Obama is predicted to actually lose the election (e.g. had simulated vote shares below 270).\n\nPrediction markets tend to exaggerate the chances of long shots winning a campaign.\n\nLet's adjust the probabilities used above using the following formula:\n\n$$p_{ij}^* = \\Phi(1.64 \\times \\Phi^{-1}(p_{ij}))$$\n\nWhere $\\Phi$ is the PDF of the [normal distribution](https://pols1600.paultesta.org/slides/08-slides.html#102) (`prnorm()` in R) and $\\Phi^{-1}$ is the CDF (`qnorm()` in R) of the normal distribution.\n\n# Compute $p_{ij}^*$, plot the transformed probabilities and explain the transformation.\n\nUsing the formula above and the `pnorm()` and `qnorm()` functions in R transform `prob_obama_win` in `df_nov3` to `p_star`.\n\nThen plot the results.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Calculate p_star\n# p_star <- pnorm(???*qnorm(???))\n\n# Plot pstar against original prob_obama_win\n# plot(x= df_nov3$prob_obama_win, y = p_star)\n\n# Add line showing p_star function\n# curve(pnorm(1.64*qnorm(x)),add=T,col=\"grey\")\n\n# Add 45 degree line showing \n# Points below = lower prob\n# Point above = higher prob\n\n# abline(a=0,b=1, lty=2)\n```\n:::\n\n\n**Please interpret the results of this transformation**\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo our transformation decreases the probability for low values of the original $p_{ij}$ and increases the probabilities of high $p_{ij}$\n\n# Using $p_{ij}^*$ repeat the simulations from above and compare the results\n\n-   Uncomment the code below and replace the `???` with the appropriate code.\n\n    -   Hint Use the code from the question 3, but replace `p_obama_win` with `p_star`\n\n-   Then plot the distribution of the old and new simulations with two histograms.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# set.seed(123)\n# obama_ev_2 <- c() # Container to hold results of each simulation\n\n# Simulation using \n# for(i in 1:sims){\n#   obama_ev_2[i] <- ???\n# }\n\n# Plot distributions\n# hist(obama_ev_1)\n# hist(obama_ev_2, add=T, col=\"red\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n**Answer:** Write your comparison of the two histograms here.\n\n-   Does using `p_star` improve the predictions?\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nInteresting, so the transformation seemed to improve the predictions in that none of the simulated values were below the 270 electoral vote threshold.\n\n# Compute the expected number of electoral votes for Obama for the 120 days before November 4.
