I'll get you started: \n\nFirst there is considerable variation in average rates of turnout across states. For example ... \n\nSecond, there is also considerable variation in turnout across election years ... \n\nAs for variation in turnout by age before and after SDR, in ...\n\n\n# Understanding Two-Way Fixed Effects Regression\n\n:::{.callout-note}\nInteresting, so there appears to be considerable variation in turnout across states and over time. Further, depending on which state you looked at you may have found evidence of differences in turnout by age group before and after SDR that either support or challenge Grumbach's main claims.\n\nIn this question, we'll see how we can use **fixed effects** to try and account for variation across states and years to **isolate** the effect of same day registration on turnout.\n\nWe will also see how using **robust standard errors** with and without clustering changes our interpretations of the significance of our results.\n:::\n\n\nIn this question you will estimate **four** increasingly complex models using `lm_robust()` and explain how each subsequent model differs from the preceding model.\n\n1. A **simple linear model**, `m1` akin to what `lm()` produces modelling turnout (`dv_voted`) as a function of same day registration (`sdr`)\n\n2. A simple linear model, `m2`  with standard errors that are **robust to heteroskedasticity** (i.e. non-constant error variance) by setting the `lm_robust()` argument: `se_type = \"stata\"` \n\n3. A two-way fixed effects model, `m3`, with **fixed effects** for `st`ate and `year` using `lm_robust()` argument: `fixed_effects = ~ st + year` and **robust standard errors** using the same argument as `m2`\n\n4. A two-way fixed effects model, `m3`, with fixed effects for `st`ate and `year` using `lm_robust()` argument: `fixed_effects = ~ st + year` **AND** robust standard errors  **clustered by state** using the argument: `clusters = st`\n\n\n\n## Estimate the models\n\nI've gotten you started with the code for `m1` Use that code as a template to estimate `m2`, `m3`, and `m4`\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# # ---- m1: Simple OLS regression ----\n# m1 <- lm_robust(dv_voted ~ sdr,\n#                 data = cps,\n#                 se_type = \"classical\",\n#                 try_cholesky = T)\n\n# ---- m2: Simple OLS with robust standard errors ----\n\n\n# ---- m3: Two-way Fixed Effects for State and Year ----\n\n\n# ---- m4: TWFE for State and Year and cluster robust SEs ----\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Present and interpret the results\n\nWhen you've completed the previous section, you should be able uncomment and run the following code\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# htmlreg(l = list(m1,m2,m3, m4),\n#         digits = 5,\n#         include.ci = F,\n#         ) %>% HTML() %>% browsable()\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n**Please write a few sentences** explaining how the coefficient on `sdr` and it's standard error changes across the four models. I'll get you started:\n\nThe table presents the results of four regression models. The outcome in each model is a binary indicator of whether respondents to the CPS voted in a given election. The key predictor of interest in each model is the coefficient for `sdr` which corresponds the model's predicted difference in turnout in states that had same day registration compared to states that did not. \n\nModel 1 presents the results from ...\n\nModel 2 presents the same specification, but uses ...\n\nModel 3 includes ...\n\nFinally, model 4 presents the results of a TWFE regression with fixed effects for state and year with ...\n\nIn sum, once we account for fixed differences across states and between time periods, and allow correlated errors between observations from the same state, variation in the presence of same day registration laws seems to explain ...\n\n\n\n# Replicate two models from Figure 3\n\nInteresting. Once we account for fixed differences across states and between time periods and allow correlated errors between observations from the same state, variation in the presence of same day registration laws seems to explain relatively little variation in voting. \n\nGrumbach and Hill, however, are interested in a different question, namely, **whether the effects of same day registration vary by age.** \n\nGrumbach and Hill test these claims using a regression model that interacts the `sdr` variable with indicators for the `age_group` of respondents. \n\nThe **combination** of the coefficient on `sdr` and the coefficient on the interaction of `sdr` with a specific age group indicator, tells us the predicted effect of `sdr` for respondents of that age group. In other words, it lets us assess whether same day registration is associated with more turnout among younger voters compared to older voters.\n\nFormally, we we can describe these models using the following notation:\n\n$$\ny_{ist} = \\beta_0 + \\overbrace{\\alpha_s}^{\\text{FE State}} + \\underbrace{\\gamma_t}_{\\text{FE Year}} + \\overbrace{\\beta_1sdr_{st}}^{\\text{ME of SDR for 65+}} + \\underbrace{\\sum_{k = 18-14}^{k = 55-64}\\beta_{k} sdr_{st}\\times age_{ist}}_{\\Delta \\text{ in ME of SDR for Age }}  +\\overbrace{X\\beta}^{\\text{Controls}}+\\epsilon_{ist}\n$$\nAnd the quantities of interest for Grumbach and Hill's claim are:\n\n$$\n\\text{Marginal Effect of SDR for 65+} = \\beta_1\n$$\nThe marginal effects of the other age groups are defined by $\\beta_1$, the marginal effect of SDR for 65+, **PLUS** the coefficient on the interaction term between SDR and each age group indicator. So for 18-24 year olds the quantity of interest is the sum of:\n\n$$\n\\text{Marginal Effect of SDR for 18-24} = \\beta_1 + \\beta_{sdr \\times 18-24}\n$$\n\nFor 25-34 year olds\n\n$$\n\\text{Marginal Effect of SDR for 25-34} = \\beta_1 + \\beta_{sdr \\times 25-34}\n$$\n\nAnd so on.\n\nPlease fit **two models** that **interact** the variable `sdr` with the variable `age_group`. Include fixed effects for `st`ate and `year`, and cluster your standard errors by `st`ate. \n\nCall one model `m1gh` and only include the interaction between same day voting and age cohorts (`sdr*age_group`).\n\nCall the second model `m2gh`. In addition to the interaction, include controls for:\n\n- `race` (as a `factor()` variable) \n- `is_female`\n- `income`\n- `education`\n\n## Estimate the models\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# ---- m1gh ----\n\n\n# ---- m2gh ----\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Present the results\n\nPlease present the results in a regression table. \n\nOnce you've estimated the models, you can just uncomment the code below:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# htmlreg(list(m1gh, m2gh), \n#         digits = 4,\n#         include.ci = F) %>% HTML() %>% browsable()\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n# Recreate Figure 3\n\nWuff. That's a lot of coefficients to sort through. \n\nMoreover, the question Grumbach and Hill are interested -- **how the marginal effect of same day registration varies by age** -- isn't directly answered by any one coefficient in the the table.\n\nThat's because the marginal effect of SDR (and it's standard error) varies conditionally on the value of age group we're looking at. \n\nThe comments to this lab contain a more formal discussion of the math behind this results. For right now, just know that to recreate Figure 3, we'll need to add the coefficients on the interactions of `sdr` with `age_group` to the coefficient on `sdr` to get the marginal effects for each age group.\n\n\n\n## Calculate Marginal Effects of Interactions\n\nIn the code below, I've written a **custom function** called `me_fn()` to calculate the **marginal effects** of Same Day Registration, a specific age cohort^[This is not a robust function, but one designed to work specifically for these data and models]\n\nThe function returns a $1\\times 5$ data frame with following columns\n\n- `Age` the Age for which we are evaluating the marginal effect of `sdr`\n- `Effect` the marginal effect in percentage points of predicted turnout of `sdr` conditional on `age_group` equaling the age cohort in `Age`\n- `SE` the standard error of this marginal effect\n- `ll` the **lower limit** of a 95 percent **confidence interval** for our estimate\n- `ul` the **upper limit** of a 95 percent **confidence interval** for our estimate\n\nWe will talk in more detail about what a **confidence interval** is in two weeks. For now, you can think of this interval as a **range of equally plausible values** for the marginal effect of SDR at a given age cohort. \n\n:::{.callout-note}\nThe heuristic for interpreting a confidence interval as a measure of statistical significance, is to ask:\n\n> Is **zero within** the upper and lower **limits of the confidence interval**. If so, then the true estimate could be negative, or it could be positive, in which case, we conclude the estimate is **not statistically significant**.\n:::\n\nPlease run the code below:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# ---- Function to calculate marginal effect and SE of interactions ----\n\nme_fn <- function(mod, cohort, ci=0.95){\n  # Confidence Level for CI\n  alpha <- 1-ci\n  z <- qnorm(1-alpha/2)\n  \n  # Age (Always one for indicator of specific cohort)\n  age <- 1\n  \n  # Variance Covariance Matrix from Model\n  cov <- vcov(mod)\n  \n  # coefficient for SDR (Marginal Effect for reference category: 65+)\n  b1 <- coef(mod)[\"sdr\"]\n  \n  # If age is one of the interactions\n  if(cohort %in% c(\"18-24\",\"25-34\",\"35-44\",\"45-54\",\"55-64\")){\n    # get the name of the specific interaction\n    the_int <- paste(\"sdr:age_group\",cohort,sep=\"\")\n    # the coefficient on the interaction\n    b2 <- coef(mod)[the_int]\n    # Calculate marginal effect for age cohort\n    me <- b1 + b2*age\n    me_se <- sqrt(cov[\"sdr\",\"sdr\"] + age^2*cov[the_int,the_int] + 2*age*cov[\"sdr\",the_int])\n    ll <- me - z*me_se\n    ul <- me + z*me_se\n  }\n  if(!cohort %in% c(\"18-24\",\"25-34\",\"35-44\",\"45-54\",\"55-64\")){\n    me <- b1 \n    me_se <- mod$std.error[\"sdr\"]\n    ll <- mod$conf.low[\"sdr\"]\n    ul <- mod$conf.high[\"sdr\"]\n  }\n\n  # scale results to be percentage points\n  res <- tibble(\n    Age = cohort,\n    Effect = me*100,\n    SE = me_se*100,\n    ll = ll*100,\n    ul = ul*100\n  )\n  return(res)\n\n\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nThen **uncomment the code** below to create the data frame to produce a version of the coefficient plots from Grumbach and Hill's Figure 3.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# ## List of age cohorts\n# the_age_groups <- levels(cps$age_group)\n# \n# ## Model 1: No controls\n# ## Estimate Marginal effect for each age cohort\n# the_age_groups %>% \n#   purrr::map_df(~me_fn(m1gh, cohort=.)) %>% \n#   # Add labels for plotting\n#   mutate(\n#     Age = factor(Age),\n#     Model = \"No controls\"\n#   ) -> fig3_no_controls\n# \n# ## Model 3: Controls for Education, Income, Race,and Sex \n# ## Estimate Marginal effect for each age cohort\n# the_age_groups %>% \n#   purrr::map_df(~me_fn(m2gh, cohort=.)) %>% \n#   # Add labels for plotting\n#   mutate(\n#     Age = factor(Age),\n#     Model = \"With controls\"\n#   ) -> fig3_controls\n#   \n# ## Combine estimates into data frame for plotting\n# fig3_df <- fig3_no_controls %>% bind_rows(fig3_controls)\n# \n# ## Display results\n# fig3_df\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n## Recreate Figure 3\n \nNow we can recreate the first and second panels in the first column of Grumbach and Hill's Figure 3.\n \nIn the code chunk below, pipe `fig3_df` into ggplot() and:\n\n- Set the `x` aesthetic to `Age`\n- Set the `y` aesthetic to `Effect`\n- Add `geom_point()`\n- Add `geom_linerange(aes(ymin = ll, ymax =ul))`\n- Add `geom_hline(yintercept = 0)`\n- Add a `facet_wrap(~Model)`\n- Set the `theme` if you like\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# --- Figure 3 ----\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Compare your figure to Figure 3 from the text\n\nFinally, **write a few sentences** comparing your results to those presented in Figure 3 of Grumbach and Hill.\n\nHere's a snapshot of the relevant panels of Figure 3 for reference:\n\n![](https://pols1600.paultesta.org/labs/images/08_fig3.png)\n\n\nPlease comment on the following:\n\n- How does the size (magnitude) of the marginal effects for 18-24 year olds compare to those reported in Figure 3? \n\n- How would you interpret this marginal effect substantively?\n\n- Are any of the marginal effects in the model with no controls statistically significant?\n\nAnd if you're interested, check out the comments for some further discussion about the differences between our replication and the published results.\n\n# Take the Class Survey {.unnumbered}\n\nPlease take a few moments to complete the [class survey](https://brown.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_eFmwvHaKLBBLoJU){target=\"_blank\"} for this week.){target=\"_blank\"} for this week.\n\n",
