It was in the field from February 28 to March 2.\n\nWe will look at how support for the war varies with the demographic predictors `age`, `sex` and `education`. We will see how multiple regression can be used to describe more complex relationships. From our baseline model, we will ask:\n\n-   Does the relationship between age and support for the war vary among male and female respondents (Interaction model)\n\n-   Does the relationship between age and support vary at different levels of age (Polynomial regression model)\n\n-   Does the relationship between age and support vary at different levels of age and does the nature of this variation differ among male and female respondents (Polynomial regression model with an interaction term)\n\nTo accomplish this, we will do the following:\n\n1.  Get set up to work and describe our data (10 minutes)\n\n2.  Get practice interpreting long chunks of codes with lots of `%>%`s (10 minutes)\n\n3.  Estimate four models of increasing complexity (15 minutes)\n\n4.  Present these models in a regression table and interpret the results (10 minutes)\n\n5.  Evaluate the relative performance of these models in terms of their variance explained $R^2$'s (15 minutes)\n\n6.  Produce predicted values to help us interpret and compare our baseline model to a model where the \"effect\" of an increase in age changes with age (10 minutes)\n\n7.  Produce predicted values to help us interpret and compare models where the \"effect\" of age is allowed to vary with respondent's sex (10 minutes)\n\nFinally, if there's time, we will:\n\n8.  Explore additional questions of our choosing in the data\n\nOne of questions 1-7 will be randomly selected as the graded question for the lab.\n\nYou will work in your assigned groups. Only one member of each group needs to submit the html file produced by knitting the lab.\n\nThis lab **must** contain the names of the group members in attendance.\n\nIf you are attending remotely, you will submit your labs individually.\n\nYou can find your assigned groups in previous [labs](https://pols1600.paultesta.org/labs/06-lab-comments.html){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n# Goals {.unnumbered}\n\nBroadly, our goals in this assignment are to:\n\n::: sidenote\n$$y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\beta_2 z + \\overbrace{\\beta_3 x\\cdot z}^{\\text{Interaction term}} $$\n:::\n\n-   Get comfortable estimating and interpreting regression models with **interaction terms**\n\n    -   Including an interaction between two variables is useful if we think the \"effect\" of one variable depends on the value of another variable.\n\n    -   Today, we test whether the association between support for the war and age differs between male and female respondents.\n\n::: sidenote\n$$x^1 = x; \\, x^2 = x\\cdot x; \\,   x^{nth} = \\prod_{i=1}^{i=n} x_i = x_1\\cdot x_2 \\cdot x_3 \\dots \\cdot x_n $$\n:::\n\n-   Get comfortable estimating and interpreting regression models with **polynomial terms**\n\n    -   Polynomial terms are a way of incorporating non-linearity in our predictors.[^1]\n\n    -   If we think the relationship between a predictor and an outcome varies at different levels of the predictor, we can include a polynomial term(s) for that predictor. Now our model will describe the relationship between $x$ and $y$ with a curve (varying slope), rather than a line (constant slope)\n\n-   Learn how to generate predicted values from our model to help us interpret **complex regression models**\n\n    -   Regression tables are great for summarizing basic regression models.\n\n    -   Models with interaction terms or polynomial terms (or both) are difficult to interpret by looking at just the coefficients themselves\n\n    -   Producing predicted values that show how the model's predictions change as variables in a interaction or polynomial change help us understand what these coefficients are telling us.\n\n-   Practice **comparing *nested* models** using the proportion of the variance explained by each model.\n\n    -   Recall that a model's $R^2$ describes the proportion of the total variance in our outcome, explained by the model's predictions.\n\n    -   When we add predictors to a model, the model becomes more flexible, and can explain more variance in the outcome.\n\n    -   *adjusted* $R^2$ adjusts models's $R^2$ by penalizing models for total number of predictors needed to explain given amount of variance\n\n    -   When models are *nested* (the predictors in a smaller model are a subset of the predictors in a larger model), we can compare the relative performance of the two using tools like $R^2$ and adjusted $R^2$.\n\n    -   When comparing models, we make trade offs between our desire to explain as much variation in the outcome as possible with a general preference for more parsimonious models.[^2]\n\n        -   For example, a simple bivariate regression and a complicated multiple regression could have the same $R^2$ (i.e. the both explain 50 percent of the total variance in the outcome), but the adjusted $R^2$ will be higher for the simple regression compared to the multiple regression, because it needed fewer predictors to explain the same amount of variance.\n\n[^1]: Mathematically, recall that the slope/first derivative of the line $y = f(x) = 2x$ is constant $(f'(x) = 2)$. If we increase x by 1, we expect y to increase by 2, while the derivative of a parabola $y = f(z) = z^2$ varies with $z$ $(f'(z) = 2x)$. Going from z= 2 to z= 3 is associated with a greater increase in y, then going from z=1 to z=2. Our model, however, is still [linear in *parameters*](https://blog.minitab.com/en/adventures-in-statistics-2/what-is-the-difference-between-linear-and-nonlinear-equations-in-regression-analysis#:~:text=In%20statistics%2C%20a%20regression%20equation,produce%20a%20U%2Dshaped%20curve.) $\\beta$. That is, it is still a linear regression. If our model included some parameter $\\theta^2$, then it would be a non-linear regression.\n\n[^2]: In a machine learning framework, we trying to find an [optimal tradeoff](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-the-bias-variance-tradeoff-165e6942b229) between reducing bias in our predictors by including more predictors and minimizing variance in predictions by not overfitting the data.\n\n# Workflow {.unnumbered}\n\n# Please knit this .Rmd file {.unnumbered}\n\nAs with every lab, you should:\n\n-   Download the file\n-   Save it in your course folder\n-   **Update the `author:` section of the YAML header to include the names of your group members in attendance.**\n-   Knit the document\n-   Open the html file in your browser (Easier to read)\n-   Write your code in the chunks provided\n-   Comment out or delete any test code you do not need\n-   **Knit the document again after completing a section or chunk** (Error checking)\n-   Upload the final lab to [Canvas](https://canvas.brown.edu/courses/1091286/assignments/7925689?module_item_id=10882050){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\n# Get setup to work\n\n## Load Packages\n\nFirst lets load the libraries we'll need for today.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nthe_packages <- c(\n  ## R Markdown\n  \"kableExtra\",\"DT\",\"texreg\",\"htmltools\",\n  #\"flair\", # Comments only\n  ## Tidyverse\n  \"tidyverse\", \"lubridate\", \"forcats\", \"haven\", \"labelled\",\n  ## Extensions for ggplot\n  \"ggmap\",\"ggrepel\", \"ggridges\", \"ggthemes\", \"ggpubr\", \n  \"GGally\", \"scales\", \"dagitty\", \"ggdag\", \"ggforce\",\n  # Data \n  \"COVID19\",\"maps\",\"mapdata\",\"qss\",\"tidycensus\", \"dataverse\",\n  # Analysis\n  \"DeclareDesign\", \"zoo\"\n)\n\n# Define function to load packages\nipak <- function(pkg){\n    new.pkg <- pkg[!(pkg %in% installed.packages()[, \"Package\"])]\n    if (length(new.pkg)) \n        install.packages(new.pkg, dependencies = TRUE)\n    sapply(pkg, require, character.only = TRUE)\n}\n\nipak(the_packages)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n   kableExtra            DT        texreg     htmltools     tidyverse \n         TRUE          TRUE          TRUE          TRUE          TRUE \n    lubridate       forcats         haven      labelled         ggmap \n         TRUE          TRUE          TRUE          TRUE          TRUE \n      ggrepel      ggridges      ggthemes        ggpubr        GGally \n         TRUE          TRUE          TRUE          TRUE          TRUE \n       scales       dagitty         ggdag       ggforce       COVID19 \n         TRUE          TRUE          TRUE          TRUE          TRUE \n         maps       mapdata           qss    tidycensus     dataverse \n         TRUE          TRUE          TRUE          TRUE          TRUE \nDeclareDesign           zoo \n         TRUE          TRUE \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Load the data\n\nNext we'll load the recoded data for the lab.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nload(url(\"https://pols1600.paultesta.org/files/data/df_drww.rda\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Describe the data\n\nAs always, it's important to get a high level overview of data when we first load it into R.\n\nBelow we take a look at the first few values of all the data.

The function then does something to this inputted data frame (add a column, pivot columns, etc) and returns a new data.frame which `%>%` then passes on to next function.\n\nTo learn how to produce a table of summary statistics (a common task for empirical work), it's helpful to understand what's happening at each step of the process in the `summary_stats` code chunk.\n\nIn the code chunk below, starting from `df_drww %>%` please\n\n-   Copy and paste the all the code up until the next `%>%`\n\n-   Run this code in your console\n\n-   Write a comment above this code in code chunk\n\nRunning code line-by-line, is great way to learn how to code, by understanding what happens in each line of code.\n\nThere are about 8 or 9 steps of code to explain (depending on how you copy and paste.)

If it is, then the change in predicted support for the war among say 20-year-olds compared to 30-year-olds, would be different than change between 30- to 40-year-olds. Interpreting polynomials terms and interaction models is much easier if, as we do later, we simply obtain and plot the predicted values from this model\n\n-   (**The marginal effect of age is constant / The marginal effect of age varies**)\n\nFor `m4` (Model 4) do the varying marginal effects of age appear to also vary by gender?[^6]\n\n[^6]: As in the previous question, basically you need to look at the table and see if the coefficients on the interaction terms are statistically significant. It's a little more complicated than this, but if they are significant, this is evidence of differences across Sex.\n\n-   (**Yes/No**)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Use $R^2$ to compare models\n\nNow take a look at the bottom rows in your regression table which show each model's $R^2$ and adjusted $R^2$.\n\nRecall from class, that $R^2$ describes the proportion of the variance in our outcome (support for the war), explained by the predictors in our model (age, sex, education, and some interactions/polynomials).\n\nYou may also remember that $R^2$ always increases as we add more predictors to the model. To account for this, we often look at the adjusted $R^2$ which weights the increase in variance explained (decrease in variance unexplained) by the number of additional predictors needed to produce that increase.\n\nYou regression table only reports results to a few decimal places.\n\nLet's use the `summary()` function to extract and save the $R^2$ (`r.squared`) and adjusted $R^2$ (`adj.r.squared`) for each model. The code for `m1` is there as an example.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# m1\n# m1_r_squared <- summary(m1)$r.squared\n# m1_r_squared\n# \n# m1_adj_r_squared <- summary(m1)$adj.r.squared\n# m1_adj_r_squared\n\n# m2\n\n\n# m3\n\n\n# m4\n```\n:::\n\n\nPlease answer the following:\n\n-   **How does the** $R^2$ change from `m1` to `m4`\n\n-   **How does the adjusted** $R^2$ change from `m1` to `m4`\n\n-   **Overall, which model should we prefer?**\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Produce and visualize predicted values for m1 and m3\n\nNow let's produce and visualize predicted values to help us interpret the relationship between age and support for the war `m1` (our baseline model) and `m3` (our polynomial model)\n\nWe demonstrated the steps for producing predicted values in Tuesday's [lecture](https://pols1600.paultesta.org/slides/07-slides.html#64)\n\nTo review: you'll need to\n\n1.
