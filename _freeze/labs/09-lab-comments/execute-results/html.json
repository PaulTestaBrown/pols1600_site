You find an outcome of interest and a variable you think predicts interesting variation in that outcome. You'll figure out what recoding you need to do, do that recoding and describe the data. I'll do the same, so can some template code to compare your work to.\n\nEverything we'll do today is something we've done before and is also something you'll likely have to do a version of in your final project.\n\n1. Set up your work space (5 minutes)\n\n2. Download and load data from the NES into R (10 minutes)\n\n3. Explore the codebook for the 2024 Pilot Study (5-10 minutes)\n\n4. Get a high level overview of the data to figure out what recoding needs to be done (5-10 minutes)\n\n5. Recode the data (15 minutes)\n\n6. Describe the data (15-20 minutes)\n\n7. Formulate a set of research questions (10 minutes)\n\n8. Save the data (5 minutes)\n\n\nOne of these 8 tasks will be randomly selected as the graded question for the lab.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(342024)\ngraded_question <- sample(1:8,size = 1)\npaste(\"Question\",graded_question,\"is the graded question for this week\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"Question 6 is the graded question for this week\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"datatables html-widget html-fill-item\" id=\"htmlwidget-06cb391e734214ac6383\" style=\"width:100%;height:auto;\"></div>\n<script type=\"application/json\" data-for=\"htmlwidget-06cb391e734214ac6383\">{\"x\":{\"filter\":\"none\",\"vertical\":false,\"data\":[[\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\",\"5\",\"6\",\"7\",\"8\"],[\"Group 1\",\"Group 2\",\"Group 3\",\"Group 4\",\"Group 5\",\"Group 6\",\"Group 7\",\"Group 8\"],[\"Maia Eng\",\"Andrew Rovinsky\",\"Serafym Rybachkivskyi\",\"Tiffany Eddy\",\"Christopher Maron\",\"Mia Hamilton\",\"Mariana Melzer\",\"Logan Szittai\"],[\"Guadalupe Herrera\",\"Spencer Lorin\",\"Rachel Kim\",\"Daniel Solomon\",\"Daniel Baker\",\"Emily Colon\",\"Kahrie Langham\",\"Keiley Thompson\"],[\"Stephen Robinson\",\"Lucinda Anderson\",\"Kai Blades\",\"Zoe Smith\",\"Neve Diaz-Carr\",\"Davis Kelly\",\"Shannon Feerick-Hillenbrand\",\"Lydell Dyer\"],[\"Jeremiah Harrington\",\"Serenity Hamilton\",\"Emma Coleman\",\"Lorena Calderon\",\"Olivia Hanley\",\"Talia Levine\",\"Jarret Fernandes\",\"Mahir Arora\"]],\"container\":\"<table class=\\\"display\\\">\\n  <thead>\\n    <tr>\\n      <th> <\\/th>\\n      <th>Group<\\/th>\\n      <th>1<\\/th>\\n      <th>2<\\/th>\\n      <th>3<\\/th>\\n      <th>4<\\/th>\\n    <\\/tr>\\n  <\\/thead>\\n<\\/table>\",\"options\":{\"columnDefs\":[{\"orderable\":false,\"targets\":0},{\"name\":\" \",\"targets\":0},{\"name\":\"Group\",\"targets\":1},{\"name\":\"1\",\"targets\":2},{\"name\":\"2\",\"targets\":3},{\"name\":\"3\",\"targets\":4},{\"name\":\"4\",\"targets\":5}],\"order\":[],\"autoWidth\":false,\"orderClasses\":false}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}</script>\n```\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Goals {.unnumbered}\n\nThis week's lab will give you practice:\n\n- Download and loading data from your own computers (Q1,Q2)\n\n- Exploring a codebook to find interesting relevant variables (Q3)\n\n- Exploring data to understand what needs to be recoded (Q4)\n  \n- Recoding data in a clear and precise manner (Q5)\n\n  - Demonstrate how to recode multiple variables using `acros()`\n\n- Describing, summarizing, and exploring data through tables and figures (Q6)\n\n  - Using `kable()` and functions from the `kableExtra` package to format tables\n  - Combining multiple figures into single plots using `ggarrange()`from the ``ggpubr` pacakge\n\n- Formulating research questions based on initial explorations of the data (Q7)\n\n- Saving data so you can use it later (Q8)\n\n\n\n\n\n# Workflow {.unnumbered}\n\n## Please render this .qmd file {.unnumbered}\n\nAs with every lab, you should:\n\n-   Download the file\n-   Save it in your course folder\n-   **Update the `author:` section of the YAML header to include the names of your group members in attendance.**\n-   Render the document\n-   Open the html file in your browser (Easier to read)\n-   Write your code in the **chunks provided under each section**\n-   Comment out or delete any test code you do not need\n-   **Render the document again after completing a section or chunk** (Error checking)\n-   Upload the final lab to [Canvas](https://canvas.brown.edu/courses/1094972/assignments){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\n\n\n# Set up your workspace\n\nIn the code chunk below, please add code to load the package `DeclareDesign`\n\n\n## Load Packages\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Libraries\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(haven)\nlibrary(labelled)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\nlibrary(ggpubr)\nlibrary(DeclareDesign)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Set your working directory in R Studio\n\nIn R studio **set your working directory** to the **folder where this lab is** saved by clicking > Session > Set Working Directory > To Source File Location\n\n![](https://pols1600.paultesta.org/labs/images/09-nes6.png){width=50%}\n\nAfter doing so uncomment `getwd()` Should print out something like\n\n> \"~/Desktop/pols1600/labs/\"\n\nDepending on where your lab is saved\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# In the Top Panel of RStudio Click\n# Session > Set Working Directory > Source File Location\n\n# Uncomment to Check Where Your File is Saved \n# getwd()\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::{.callout-note}\nIf `getwd()` says something like '~/Downloads/' click: \"File > Save As\" and **save this lab** in your **course folder**.

Study contains responses from 1909 individuals^[See note below]. The typical respondent in the data was just under 50 years old, with some college, with an income in the range of \\$50k-\\$59k. Approximately two-thirds of the sample identified as white, with 13 percent of respondents identifying as Black, 13 percent as Hispanic, 2 percent as Asian. Forty-three percent of respondents identified as Democrats, 38 percent as Republicans, and 20 percent as Independents. The respondents were evenly split in who they would vote for 2024, with 50 percent saying they would Vote for Donald Trump, and 50 percent saying Joe Biden. In the 2020 campaign, the average respondent reported engaging in about 1 act of political participation. \n\n\n------\n\n\nNote, that technically, 024 Pilot Study contains three types of respondents described by `sample_type`: \n\n- 1,500 respondents who are part of a weighted sample that generalizes to the U.S. population\n- 113 respondents who completed the survey, but were not included in the panel-matching procedure used to construct construct a representative sample\n- 296 respondents who didn't complete the whole survey.\n\nSo, *technically speaking*^[Which is [the best kind of speaking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hou0lU8WMgo)], if we wanted to draw inferences about the proportion of American's planning to to vote for Trump or Biden in 2024, we should only look at the 1,500 respondents in the weighted sample, and we should calculate that proportion using the sampling weights provided by `weights`. \n\nSurvey weights are complicated things, but the basically idea is that each observation is the sample is representative of observations in the population. Some types of observations will be over-represented in our sample -- these are given smaller weights -- while others are under-represented -- these are given greater weights.\n\nQuick look at the highest and lowest survey weights seems to suggest to me that weighting procedure is giving more weight to respondents with lower levels of education, and income, and less weight to higher incomes and education levels.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf %>% filter(\n weight > quantile(weight, .99, na.rm=T)\n ) %>% \n  select(weight, gender, age, race_5cat, education, income, partyid)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 15 × 7\n   weight gender       age race_5cat education                income    partyid \n    <dbl> <dbl+lbl>  <dbl> <fct>     <dbl+lbl>                <dbl+lbl> <dbl+lb>\n 1   7.00 1 [Male]      23 Hispanic  3 [Some college]          4 [$30,…  3 [Lea…\n 2   3.33 1 [Male]      31 Other     2 [High school graduate] NA         2 [Not…\n 3   2.96 2 [Female]    33 Hispanic  1 [No HS credential]     NA         4 [Ind…\n 4   3.36 1 [Male]      68 Black     3 [Some college]         NA         4 [Ind…\n 5   2.94 1 [Male]      67 Hispanic  1 [No HS credential]      2 [$10,…  2 [Not…\n 6   4.13 1 [Male]      22 Hispanic  3 [Some college]         11 [$120…  4 [Ind…\n 7   3.64 2 [Female]    58 Black     5 [4-year degree]         6 [$50,… NA      \n 8   3.30 1 [Male]      43 Hispanic  5 [4-year degree]         7 [$60,…  4 [Ind…\n 9   3.51 1 [Male]      69 White     2 [High school graduate]  4 [$30,…  7 [Str…\n10   3.32 1 [Male]      74 White     2 [High school graduate]  6 [$50,…  3 [Lea…\n11   3.32 1 [Male]      69 White     2 [High school graduate]  3 [$20,…  4 [Ind…\n12   3.51 1 [Male]      75 White     2 [High school graduate]  2 [$10,…  7 [Str…\n13   2.93 1 [Male]      41 Black     4 [2-year degree]         4 [$30,…  2 [Not…\n14   4.20 2 [Female]    63 Black     6 [Post-grad]             3 [$20,…  6 [Not…\n15   3.32 1 [Male]      67 White     2 [High school graduate]  5 [$40,…  3 [Lea…\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf %>% filter(\n  weight < quantile(weight, .01, na.rm=T)\n) %>% \n  select(weight, gender, age, race_5cat, education, income, partyid)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 12 × 7\n   weight gender       age race_5cat education                income     partyid\n    <dbl> <dbl+lbl>  <dbl> <fct>     <dbl+lbl>                <dbl+lbl>  <dbl+l>\n 1  0.314 1 [Male]      77 Black     6 [Post-grad]            10 [$100,… 1 [Str…\n 2  0.409 2 [Female]    29 Black     6 [Post-grad]            14 [$250,… 1 [Str…\n 3  0.382 1 [Male]      23 Hispanic  5 [4-year degree]        10 [$100,… 5 [Lea…\n 4  0.439 2 [Female]    26 Asian     5 [4-year degree]        12 [$150,… 2 [Not…\n 5  0.421 2 [Female]    57 Hispanic  6 [Post-grad]             6 [$50,0… 5 [Lea…\n 6  0.415 2 [Female]    52 Hispanic  6 [Post-grad]             6 [$50,0… 3 [Lea…\n 7  0.455 1 [Male]      72 Other     6 [Post-grad]             7 [$60,0… 7 [Str…\n 8  0.405 1 [Male]      32 Hispanic  5 [4-year degree]        11 [$120,… 4 [Ind…\n 9  0.362 2 [Female]    33 Black     5 [4-year degree]         1 [Less … 1 [Str…\n10  0.411 1 [Male]      42 Black     2 [High school graduate]  4 [$30,0… 4 [Ind…\n11  0.362 2 [Female]    33 Black     5 [4-year degree]         1 [Less … 1 [Str…\n12  0.346 1 [Male]      71 Black     6 [Post-grad]             2 [$10,0… 1 [Str…\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nSampling weights are a can worms we won't deal with in this class.

In the code below we see that distributions of race and ethnicity are pretty similar in the weighted and full samples, but using survey weights seems to suggest that Biden's support as actually higher than Trumps, although the confidence intervals (Next week!) for both overlap 0.5 suggesting the race is essentially tied.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# install.packages(\"survey\")\n# install.packages(\"srvyr\")\nlibrary(survey)\nlibrary(srvyr)\n\n# Format as survey_design object\ndf_s <- as_survey_design(df %>% filter(sample_type == 1),weight = weight)\n\n# Calculate weighted totals and proportions\ndf_s %>% \n  group_by(race) %>% \n  summarise(\n    total = survey_total(),\n    proption = survey_mean()\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 7 × 5\n  race                   total total_se proption proption_se\n  <dbl+lbl>              <dbl>    <dbl>    <dbl>       <dbl>\n1 1 [White]             1005.     21.6   0.670       0.0139 \n2 2 [Black]              193.     15.7   0.129       0.0102 \n3 3 [Hispanic]           189.     15.9   0.126       0.0102 \n4 4 [Asian]               35.6     6.36  0.0237      0.00423\n5 5 [Native American]     11.8     3.26  0.00789     0.00218\n6 6 [Two or more races]   46.8     7.52  0.0312      0.00499\n7 7 [Other]               17.8     5.53  0.0119      0.00367\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Compare to unweighted estimates\ndf %>%\n  group_by(race) %>% \n  summarise(\n    total = n()\n  ) %>% \n  mutate(\n    propotion = total/sum(total)\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 8 × 3\n  race                  total propotion\n  <dbl+lbl>             <int>     <dbl>\n1 1 [White]              1270  0.665   \n2 2 [Black]               242  0.127   \n3 3 [Hispanic]            239  0.125   \n4 4 [Asian]                44  0.0230  \n5 5 [Native American]      17  0.00891 \n6 6 [Two or more races]    69  0.0361  \n7 7 [Other]                27  0.0141  \n8 8 [Middle Eastern]        1  0.000524\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Calculated weighted proportions of support\ndf_s %>% \n  group_by(dv_vote_trump2024) %>%\n  summarise(\n    proportion = survey_mean()\n  ) %>% select(dv_vote_trump2024,proportion, proportion_se)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n  dv_vote_trump2024 proportion proportion_se\n              <dbl>      <dbl>         <dbl>\n1                 0     0.510        0.0142 \n2                 1     0.476        0.0142 \n3                NA     0.0139       0.00363\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Compare to unweighted proportions just among those in weighted sample\ndf %>%\n  filter(sample_type == 1) %>% \n  group_by(dv_vote_trump2024) %>% \n  summarise(\n    total = n()\n  ) %>% \n  mutate(\n    propotion = total/sum(total)\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n  dv_vote_trump2024 total propotion\n              <dbl> <int>     <dbl>\n1                 0   755     0.503\n2                 1   727     0.485\n3                NA    18     0.012\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# And overall\ndf %>%\n  group_by(dv_vote_trump2024) %>% \n  summarise(\n    total = n()\n  ) %>% \n  mutate(\n    propotion = total/sum(total)\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n  dv_vote_trump2024 total propotion\n              <dbl> <int>     <dbl>\n1                 0   866    0.454 \n2                 1   869    0.455 \n3                NA   174    0.0911\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Formally test whether trumps support is above 50 percent\ndf_s %>% \nsvyttest((dv_vote_trump2024==1) -

Hispanic and Asian respondents have the youngest median age of (40 years). Whites are also tend to lean more Republican in their partisanship than other racial minority groups. This is particularly true for older whites in the sample. Interestingly, average partisanship stays roughly constant with age for Asians and Hispanics, but older Black respondents are more likely to identify as Democrats than younger Blacks, whose partisan identification is more independent.\n\n**Please produce your own figure and provide a similar interpretation of what it conveys.**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n# Formulate a research question\n\nPlease take a moment, formulate a research question you might ask of your data for next week's lab\n\n\nHere's an example of some questions I might ask of these data\n\n**Research Question: Age, Race, and Support For Trump**\n\nBroadly, I'm interested in how support for Trump in the 2024 election varies with age and race. On average, I expect that older voters will be more supportive of Trump, but suspect that this trend varies by race. I expect it will be particularly true among White voters, but less so among People of color. Finally, I wonder whether these specific relationships hold, once we control for variations in partisan identification which we know varies both by age and race.\n\n**Research Question: Education, Income, and Political Participation**\n\nWhat's the relationship between income, education, and political?^[In general, I'm often ambivalent on this kind of \"What's the effect of x on y\" phrasing. I think it's fine for framing, but the real question I'm interested in is something about the interaction and relative effects of income and education on participation, hence the subsequent clarification of research question.] Past research suggests both are associated with higher rates of political participation. But I wish to know whether the effects of one varies conditional on the levels of the other. Are income education complements, amplifying each others' association with participation? Or are they possibly substitutes, such that increases in education for the low income might reduce gaps in rates of participation compared to higher income individuals?\n\n \n\n\n# Save your data\n\nFinally, save your data so you can load all the work you've done today and hit the ground running, next lab.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# save(df, file = \"nes24.rda\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n# Take the Class Survey {.unnumbered}\n\nPlease take a few moments to complete the [class survey](https://brown.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_5itnKQBX4cQGCsm){target=\"_blank\"} for this week.){target=\"_blank\"} for this week.\n",
