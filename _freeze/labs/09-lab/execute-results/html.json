You find an outcome of interest and a variable you think predicts interesting variation in that outcome. You'll figure out what recoding you need to do, do that recoding and describe the data. I'll do the same, so can some template code to compare your work to.\n\nEverything we'll do today is something we've done before and is also something you'll likely have to do a version of in your final project. Here's the plan\n\n1. Set up your work space (5 minutes)\n\n2. Download and load data from the NES into R (10 minutes)\n\n3. Explore the codebook for the 2024 Pilot Study (5-10 minutes)\n\n4. Get a high level overview of the data to figure out what recoding needs to be done (5-10 minutes)\n\n5. Recode the data (15 minutes)\n\n6. Describe the data (15-20 minutes)\n\n7. Formulate a set of research questions (10 minutes)\n\n8. Save the data (5 minutes)\n\nFinally, as always please take the class survey.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"datatables html-widget html-fill-item\" id=\"htmlwidget-a68832e9fd9e7279d6cd\" style=\"width:100%;height:auto;\"></div>\n<script type=\"application/json\" data-for=\"htmlwidget-a68832e9fd9e7279d6cd\">{\"x\":{\"filter\":\"none\",\"vertical\":false,\"data\":[[\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\",\"5\",\"6\",\"7\",\"8\"],[\"Group 1\",\"Group 2\",\"Group 3\",\"Group 4\",\"Group 5\",\"Group 6\",\"Group 7\",\"Group 8\"],[\"Maia Eng\",\"Andrew Rovinsky\",\"Serafym Rybachkivskyi\",\"Tiffany Eddy\",\"Christopher Maron\",\"Mia Hamilton\",\"Mariana Melzer\",\"Logan Szittai\"],[\"Guadalupe Herrera\",\"Spencer Lorin\",\"Rachel Kim\",\"Daniel Solomon\",\"Daniel Baker\",\"Emily Colon\",\"Kahrie Langham\",\"Keiley Thompson\"],[\"Stephen Robinson\",\"Lucinda Anderson\",\"Kai Blades\",\"Zoe Smith\",\"Neve Diaz-Carr\",\"Davis Kelly\",\"Shannon Feerick-Hillenbrand\",\"Lydell Dyer\"],[\"Jeremiah Harrington\",\"Serenity Hamilton\",\"Emma Coleman\",\"Lorena Calderon\",\"Olivia Hanley\",\"Talia Levine\",\"Jarret Fernandes\",\"Mahir Arora\"]],\"container\":\"<table class=\\\"display\\\">\\n  <thead>\\n    <tr>\\n      <th> <\\/th>\\n      <th>Group<\\/th>\\n      <th>1<\\/th>\\n      <th>2<\\/th>\\n      <th>3<\\/th>\\n      <th>4<\\/th>\\n    <\\/tr>\\n  <\\/thead>\\n<\\/table>\",\"options\":{\"columnDefs\":[{\"orderable\":false,\"targets\":0},{\"name\":\" \",\"targets\":0},{\"name\":\"Group\",\"targets\":1},{\"name\":\"1\",\"targets\":2},{\"name\":\"2\",\"targets\":3},{\"name\":\"3\",\"targets\":4},{\"name\":\"4\",\"targets\":5}],\"order\":[],\"autoWidth\":false,\"orderClasses\":false}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}</script>\n```\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Goals {.unnumbered}\n\nThis week's lab will give you practice:\n\n- Download and loading data from your own computers (Q1,Q2)\n\n- Exploring a codebook to find interesting relevant variables (Q3)\n\n- Exploring data to understand what needs to be recoded (Q4)\n  \n- Recoding data in a clear and precise manner (Q5)\n\n  - Demonstrate how to recode multiple variables using `across()`\n\n- Describing, summarizing, and exploring data through tables and figures (Q6)\n\n  - Using `kable()` and functions from the `kableExtra` package to format tables\n  - Combining multiple figures into single plots using `ggarrange()`from the ``ggpubr` pacakge\n\n- Formulating research questions based on initial explorations of the data (Q7)\n\n- Saving data so you can use it later (Q8)\n\n\n# Workflow {.unnumbered}\n\n## Please render this .qmd file {.unnumbered}\n\nAs with every lab, you should:\n\n-   Download the file\n-   Save it in your course folder\n-   **Update the `author:` section of the YAML header to include the names of your group members in attendance.**\n-   Render the document\n-   Open the html file in your browser (Easier to read)\n-   Write your code in the **chunks provided under each section**\n-   Comment out or delete any test code you do not need\n-   **Render the document again after completing a section or chunk** (Error checking)\n-   Upload the final lab to [Canvas](https://canvas.brown.edu/courses/1094972/assignments){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\n\n\n# Set up your workspace\n\nIn the code chunk below, please add code to load the package `DeclareDesign`\n\n\n## Load Packages\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Libraries\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(haven)\nlibrary(labelled)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\nlibrary(ggpubr)\n## ADD DeclareDesign\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Set your working directory in R Studio\n\nIn R studio **set your working directory** to the **folder where this lab is** saved by clicking > Session > Set Working Directory > To Source File Location\n\n![](images/09-nes6.png){width=50%}\n\nAfter doing so uncomment `getwd()` Should print out something like\n\n> \"~/Desktop/pols1600/labs/\"\n\nDepending on where your lab is saved\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# In the Top Panel of RStudio Click\n# Session > Set Working Directory > Source File Location\n\n# Uncomment to Check Where Your File is Saved \n# getwd()\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::{.callout-note}\nIf `getwd()` says something like '~/Downloads/' click: \"File > Save As\" and **save this lab** in your **course folder**.

The typical respondent in the data was just under 50 years old, with some college, with an income in the range of \\$50k-\\$59k. Approximately two-thirds of the sample identified as white, with 13 percent of respondents identifying as Black, 13 percent as Hispanic, 2 percent as Asian. Forty-three percent of respondents identified as Democrats, 38 percent as Republicans, and 20 percent as Independents. The respondents were evenly split in who they would vote for 2024, with 50 percent saying they would Vote for Donald Trump, and 50 percent saying Joe Biden. In the 2020 campaign, the average respondent reported engaging in about 1 act of political participation. \n\n\n\n## Visualize the Data\n\nPlease a choose a variable or variables whose distribution or relationship you think may be substantively interesting to the potential story you want to tell.\n\nIn the code below, I visualize: \n\n- the distribution of age by race using `geom_boxplot()`\n- average partisanship by race using `stat_summary()`\n- how partisanship changes with age by race using `geom_smooth()`\n\nAnd combine these 3 plots into a single figure using two calls to the `ggarrange()` function from the `ggpubr` package\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# fig_age_race <- df %>% \n#   ggplot(aes(race_5cat,age,\n#              col = race_5cat))+\n#   geom_boxplot()+\n#   labs(\n#     x = \"Race\",\n#     y = \"Age\",\n#     col = \"Race\",\n#     title = \"Distribution of Age by Race\"\n#   )+\n#   theme_minimal()\n# \n# fig_pid_race <- df %>% \n#   ggplot(aes(race_5cat,partyid,\n#              col = race_5cat))+\n#   stat_summary(position = position_dodge(width=.5))+\n#   labs(\n#     x = \"Race\",\n#     y = \"Partisanship\",\n#     col = \"Race\",\n#     title = \"Average Partisanship by Race\"\n#   )+\n#   theme_minimal()\n# \n# fig_age_race_pid <- df %>% \n#   mutate(\n#     Race = race_5cat\n#   ) %>% \n#   ggplot(aes(age,partyid,\n#              col = race_5cat\n#              ))+\n#   geom_smooth(se = F) +\n#   geom_jitter(size=.5, alpha=.3) +\n#   labs(\n#     x = \"age\",\n#     y = \"Partisanship\",\n#     col = \"Race\",\n#     title = \"Distribution of Partisanship by Age and Race\"\n#   )+\n#   theme_minimal()\n# \n# fig_desc <- ggarrange(\n#   # Top Row, two columns\n#   ggarrange(\n#     fig_age_race, fig_pid_race,\n#     ncol =2,\n#     legend = \"none\"\n#     ), \n#   # Bottom row, 1 column\n#   fig_age_race_pid, \n#   nrow=2,\n#   common.legend = T,\n#   legend = \"bottom\",\n#   heights = c(1,1.5)\n#   )\n# \n# fig_desc\n```\n:::\n\n\nFrom the figure, we  see that whites in sample have the highest median age (55 years) followed by Blacks (46 years). Hispanic and Asian respondents have the youngest median age of (40 years). Whites are also tend to lean more Republican in their partisanship than other racial minority groups. This is particularly true for older whites in the sample. Interestingly, average partisanship stays roughly constant with age for Asians and Hispanics, but older Black respondents are more likely to identify as Democrats than younger Blacks, whose partisan identification is more independent.\n\n**Please produce your own figure and provide a similar interpretation of what it conveys.**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n# Formulate a research question\n\nPlease take a moment, formulate a research question you might ask of your data for next week's lab\n\n\nHere's an example of some questions I might ask of these data\n\n**Research Question: Age, Race, and Support For Trump**\n\nBroadly, I'm interested in how support for Trump in the 2024 election varies with age and race. On average, I expect that older voters will be more supportive of Trump, but suspect that this trend varies by race. I expect it will be particularly true among White voters, but less so among People of color. Finally, I wonder whether these specific relationships hold, once we control for variations in partisan identification which we know varies both by age and race.\n\n**Research Question: Education, Income, and Political Participation**\n\nWhat's the relationship between income, education, and political?^[In general, I'm often ambivalent on this kind of \"What's the effect of x on y\" phrasing. I think it's fine for framing, but the real question I'm interested in is something about the interaction and relative effects of income and education on participation, hence the subsequent clarification of research question.] Past research suggests both are associated with higher rates of political participation. But I wish to know whether the effects of one varies conditional on the levels of the other. Are income education complements, amplifying each others' association with participation? Or are they possibly substitutes, such that increases in education for the low income might reduce gaps in rates of participation compared to higher income individuals?\n\n \n\n\n# Save your data\n\nFinally, save your data so you can load all the work you've done today and hit the ground running, next lab.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# save(df, file = \"nes24.rda\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n# Take the Class Survey {.unnumbered}\n\nPlease take a few moments to complete the [class survey](https://brown.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_5itnKQBX4cQGCsm){target=\"_blank\"} for this week.){target=\"_blank\"} for this week.\n",
