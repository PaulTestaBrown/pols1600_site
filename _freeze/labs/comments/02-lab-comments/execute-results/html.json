Then, I'll need to get the data. And then...\")\n-   **Think and write programmatically**\n    -   In this .Rmd file, I'll first ask you to outline, conceptually, all the steps you'll need to do to produce this figure.\n    -   Don't worry if you can't think of all the necessary steps or aren't sure of the order. We'll produce a collective outline of what we need to do before getting to the actual coding\n    -   When we do code, I'll ask you to organize your code as outlined below:\n        -   Separate your steps into sections using the `#` headers in Markdown\n        -   Write a brief overview in words that a normal human can understand, what the code in that section is doing\n        -   Paste the code for that section into a code chunk\n        -   Add brief comments to this code to help your reader understand what's happening\n        -   Knit your document after completing each section.\n-   **Mapping concepts to code**\n    -   Again you shouldn't have to write much code. Just copy and paste from the labs and slides.\n    -   Your goal for today is to interpret that code and develop a mental map that allows you to say when I want to do this type of task (say \"recode data\"), I need to use some combination of these functions (`%>%`, `mutate()`, maybe `group_by()` or `case_when()`)\n    -   But shouldn't we be writing our own code?! Yes. Sure. Eventually.\n    -   The tutorials give you practice writing single commands, and by the end of the class you should be able write this code like this for to accomplish similar tasks\n    -   But even then, you will not be writing code from memory. I still have to Google functions, and often search my old code to find a clever solution to task.\n    -   Everyone starts learning to code by copying and pasting other people's code.\n    -   This will help minimize (but not eliminate) syntactic errors, while over time we get better writing code from scratch and fixing errors as the develop.\n-   **Practice wrangling data**\n    -   How do you load data?\n    -   How do you look at data?\n    -   How do you transform data?\n-   **Practice visualizing data**\n    -   Using the grammar of graphics to translate raw data into visual graphics\n    -   Understanding the components of this grammar:\n        -   data\n        -   aesthetics\n        -   geometries\n        -   facets\n        -   statistics\n        -   coordinates\n        -   themes\n    -   Exploring what happens when we change these components\n\nWe'll work in pairs and periodically check in as a class to check our progress, review concepts, and share insights.\n\nFor fun, let's say that the first group that successfully recreates this figure gets to choose one of the following non-monetary prizes:\n\n-   I'll tell them a joke\n-   One AMA I will answer truthfully\n-   One question to be asked on the weekly class survey\n-   0.00001% extra credit added to their final grade for the course.\n\nIf we finish early, you're free to go. If you want, we can take some time to [explore some additional figures](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/index.html){target=\"_blank\"} we might produce like [maps](https://jtr13.github.io/cc19/different-ways-of-plotting-u-s-map-in-r.html){target=\"_blank\"} or [lollipop](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/lollipop-plot.html){target=\"_blank\"} plots.\n\nOk, let's begin!\n\n# Please knit this .Rmd file {.unnumbered}\n\nFor every lab:\n\n-   Download the file\n-   Save it in your course folder\n-   Knit the document\n-   Open the html file in your browser (Easier to read)\n-   Knit the document again after completing a section or chunk (Error checking)\n-   Upload the final lab to [Canvas](https://canvas.brown.edu/courses/1087979/assignments/7870521?module_item_id=10762395){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\n# Describe the components of the figure you're trying to reprodce\n\nRecall, that we need `data`, `aesthetic` mappings and `geometries` to produce a figure\n\n-   What are the aesthetic mappings in this plot\n    -   `x` average number of new cases per capita by month and policy\n    -   `y` a variable indexing year and month\n    -   `col` a variable indexing the face mask policy in place\n-   What is the geometry?\n    -   points using `geom_point()`\n-   What is the data set used? (Hint it's a transformation of `covid_us`)\n    -   From the comments to last week's lab, I know I need to produce something like `cases_by_month_and_policy` from the `covid_us` data\n\n# Outline the steps you will need to complete this process {.unnumbered}\n\n1.  Set up our work space\n2.  Download the COVID-19 data\n3.  Get a high level overview of the data\n4.  Recode the data\n5.  Calculate the average number of new cases in a given month for states with a given policy on face masks\n6.  Produce an initial figure\n7.  Refine the figure\n\n# Set up our workspace\n\nFirst we need to get R ready to work by loading (and if need installing) any packages that we will be using.\n\nFrom Tuesday's [slides](https://pols1600.paultesta.org/slides/02-slides.html#8){target=\"_blank\"} I will\n\n## Create an object listing all the packages I will use today\n\nThis code creates a object called `the_packages` which contains a vector of character strings corresponding to the names of the packages I want to use today\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nthe_packages <- c(\n  ## R Markdown\n  \"tinytex\", \"kableExtra\",\n  ## Tidyverse\n  \"tidyverse\",\"lubridate\", \"forcats\", \"haven\",\"labelled\",\n  ## Extensions for ggplot\n  \"ggmap\",\"ggrepel\", \"ggridges\", \"ggthemes\",\"ggpubr\",\n  \"GGally\",\n  # Data \n  \"COVID19\",\"maps\",\"mapdata\",\"DT\"\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Define a function to install and load packages\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nipak <- function(pkg){\n    new.pkg <- pkg[!(pkg %in% installed.packages()[, \"Package\"])]\n    if (length(new.pkg)) \n        install.packages(new.pkg, dependencies = TRUE)\n    sapply(pkg, require, character.only = TRUE)\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Use the ipak function to load the necessary packages\n\nNow I run the `ipak()` giving it the object `the_packages` as an input.

Roughly we'll need to:\n\n-   Filter out U.S. territories\n-   Create a variable called `state` from the `administrative_area_level_2` variable\n-   Group by this state variable and calculate:\n    -   the number of new cases in a state on given day\n    -   the number of new cases in a state on given day per capita\n    -   the type of face mask policy in effect in a state.\n    -   A variable that contains just the year and month of a given observation\n\nI'd probably use the code from the comments to [Lab 01](https://pols1600.paultesta.org/labs/01-lab-comments.html#5_Replicate_the_data_cleaning_and_recoding_from_class){target=\"_blank\"} as my guide.\n\nThat code will also calculate the percentage of a state's population that's vaccinated, which might be interesting to explore later.\n\n## Filter out U.S. Territories\n\nFor simplicity, (and practice filtering observations), I've asked us to remove observations from U.S. territories.\n\nThe code below\n\n-   Creates an object called `us_territories`.\n-   Use this object to filter out observations that are US territories\n-   Creates a new data frame that is just observations from the 50 U.S. states. and D.C.\n-   Checks that this recoding seems to have worked\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# U.S. Territories\nterritories <- c(\n  \"American Samoa\",\n  \"Guam\",\n  \"Northern Mariana Islands\",\n  \"Puerto Rico\",\n  \"Virgin Islands\"\n  )\n\n# Filter out U.S. Territories\ncovid_us <- covid %>%\n  filter(!administrative_area_level_2 %in% territories)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n\n```\nError in covid %>% filter(!administrative_area_level_2 %in% territories): could not find function \"%>%\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Check to make sure covid_us contains only 50 states and D.C.\ndim(covid)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 80156    47\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndim(covid_us)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n\n```\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'covid_us' not found\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlength(unique(covid$administrative_area_level_2)) \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 56\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlength(unique(covid_us$administrative_area_level_2)) == 51\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n\n```\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'covid_us' not found\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Create a `state` variable\n\nThis is purely for convenience, because typing `administrative_area_level_2` is annoying. The code copies the values of this variable into a new variable called `state` using the `mutate()` function.\n\nMutate returns the original data frame plus the new column. We have to save this output for our our changes to persist (i.e. we have to assign the output of `mutate()` back into `covid_us`)\n\nIn last week's lab, I just `piped` the output to the next command, did some more recoding with mutate, and then finally saved the output back into `covid_us`. In this lab, I'll save the output after each step.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncovid_us %>%\n  mutate(\n    state = administrative_area_level_2,\n  ) -> covid_us\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n\n```\nError in covid_us %>% mutate(state = administrative_area_level_2, ): could not find function \"%>%\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Group by the `state` variable to calculate new Covid-19 cases\n\nNow I use this shorter variable `state` to calculate the number of new cases (`new_cases`) in a given state on a given date, and rescale this variable so that it's expressed in terms of new cases per 100,000 residents.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncovid_us %>%\n  dplyr::group_by(state) %>%\n  mutate(\n    new_cases = confirmed - lag(confirmed),\n    new_cases_pc = new_cases / population *100000\n    ) -> covid_us\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n\n```\nError in covid_us %>% dplyr::group_by(state) %>% mutate(new_cases = confirmed - : could not find function \"%>%\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe slides from Tuesday, helped demonstrate what this code was doing, and why we wanted to group by state.\n\nHere's an example for a subset of the data from April 1, 2020 to April 7, 2020\n\nWe see that the `lag()` function simply moves the observation of a variable \"up\" one row so that we can take the difference between the total number of cases in a state on one date and the total number of cases on the date before, to calculate the number of *new* cases\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncovid_us %>%\n  filter(date >= \"2020-04-01\" & date < \"2020-04-07\")%>%\n  group_by(state) %>%\n  select(state, date, confirmed)%>%\n  mutate(\n    confirmed_lag1 = lag(confirmed),\n    new_cases = confirmed - lag(confirmed)\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n\n```\nError in covid_us %>% filter(date >= \"2020-04-01\" & date < \"2020-04-07\") %>% : could not find function \"%>%\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIf we hadn't grouped by state, then when we lagged the `confirmed` variable, R thinks the number of confirmed cases in California before April 1, 2020, is 986 which is actually the number of cases in Minnesota on April 7, 2020\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncovid_us %>%\n  filter(date >= \"2020-04-01\" & date < \"2020-04-07\")%>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  select(state, date, confirmed)%>%\n  mutate(\n    confirmed_lag1 = lag(confirmed),\n    new_cases = confirmed - lag(confirmed)\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n\n```\nError in covid_us %>% filter(date >= \"2020-04-01\" & date < \"2020-04-07\") %>% : could not find function \"%>%\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Recode the `facial_coverings` variable\n\nNext we use the `case_when()` function inside the `mutate()` function to create a variable called `face_masks` based on the values of the `facial_coverings` variable in the data.\n\n`case_when()` when uses R's ability to make logical comparisons. When the variable `facial_coverings` equals 0, R will input the character string `\"No policy\"` into the `face_masks` variable.\n\nWhen the absolute value of `facial_coverings` equals 1 (i.e.`facial_coverings` equals 1 or -1 ), R will input the character string `\"Recommended\"` into the `face_masks` variable. And so on.\n\nWe use the `abs()` function to take the absolute value of the `facial_coverings` variable because codebook for these data implied:\n\n> In short: positive integers identify policies applied to the entire administrative area. Negative integers are used to identify policies that represent a best guess of the policy in force, but may not represent the real status of the given area. The negative sign is used solely to distinguish the two cases, it should not be treated as a real negative value.\n\nWe know from last weeks lab, that negative values in the U.S. typically seem to be cases where a city had a more stringent policy than the state (e.g. Chicago adopts more stringent face mask policies than Illinois).\n\nFinally, we put a `%>%` after the output of `case_when()` and pass it's output to the `factor()` function.\n\nThe `.` acts as sort of placeholder, `factor()` expects some input here (like a variable from a data frame), `.` tells R to use the output of `case_when()`.\n\nThe `levels =` then transforms the character data produced by `case_when()` into a `factor` with an implicit ordering of levels (i.e. \"No policy\" \\< \"Recommended\"\\< \"Some requirements\" \\<\"Required shared places\" \\<\"Required all times\") which turns out to be useful trick for organizing how data are plotted and visualized.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncovid_us %>%\n  mutate(\n    face_masks = case_when(\n      facial_coverings == 0 ~ \"No policy\",\n      abs(facial_coverings) == 1 ~ \"Recommended\",\n      abs(facial_coverings) == 2 ~ \"Some requirements\",\n      abs(facial_coverings) == 3 ~ \"Required shared places\",\n      abs(facial_coverings) == 4 ~ \"Required all times\",\n    ) %>% factor(.,\n      levels = c(\"No policy\",\"Recommended\",\n                 \"Some requirements\",\n                 \"Required shared places\",\n                 \"Required all times\")\n    ) \n    ) -> covid_us\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n\n```\nError in covid_us %>% mutate(face_masks = case_when(facial_coverings == : could not find function \"%>%\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Create a variable capturing the year and month of the observation\n\nFinally we create some variables that extract components of an observation's date:\n\n-   `year = year(date)` returns just the year from a variable of class `Date`\n-   `month = month(date)` returns just the month from a variable of class `Date`\n-   `year_month = paste(year, str_pad(month, width = 2, pad=0), sep = \"-\")` pastes these to variables together.\n-   `str_pad(month, width = 2, pad=0)` adds a leading 0 to any month with only 1 digit, to ensure that all the months have 2 characters.\n\nThe code from your lab also calculates the percent of a states population that is vaccinated, which isn't strictly needed for today.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncovid_us %>%\n  mutate(\n    year = year(date),\n    month = month(date),\n    year_month = paste(year, str_pad(month, width = 2, pad=0), sep = \"-\"),\n    percent_vaccinated = people_fully_vaccinated/population*100  \n    ) -> covid_us\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n\n```\nError in covid_us %>% mutate(year = year(date), month = month(date), year_month = paste(year, : could not find function \"%>%\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nCreating separte `year` and `month` variables aren't strictly necessary,\n\nWe could have written something like:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncovid_us %>%\n  mutate(\n    year_month = paste(year(date), str_pad(month(date), width = 2, pad=0), sep = \"-\"),\n    percent_vaccinated = people_fully_vaccinated/population*100  \n    ) -> covid_us\n```\n:::\n\n\nBut that `year_month` line was already feeling kind of clunky, and maybe we'll want the `year` and `month` variables later.\n\n# Calculate the average number of new cases in a given month for states with a given policy on face mask\n\n-   To calculate averages, we'll use the `mean()` function\n-   To calculate averages separately by month and year and by type of face mask policy, we'll use the `group_by()` function.\n-   To make these values more legible, we'll round them to integers\n-   To count the total number of states with a given policy in a given month, we'll use the unique command to return a string with the list unique names of states with say Recommended face mask policies in a month (e.g. April 2020), and the `length()` command to count up how many states.\n-   Finally we'll save the output of this collection of code to an object called `cases_by_month_and_policy` which we'll use to produce our figure.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Data\ncovid_us %>%\n  #
