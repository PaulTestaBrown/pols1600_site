Things like `for()` loops, `functions()` and `apply()` can reduce the amount of copying, pasting and replacing you have to do, which in turn can reduce the amount of errors induced by forgetting to change a variable name, or mistyping a command.\n\nBut the first time you see a for loop, or define your own function, it will likely seem a bit abstract, and obtuse.That's ok. The goal is that you have a better, if not perfect, understanding of these concepts which we will use throughout the course.\n\n# Read Ferwerda and Miller (2014) and answer the following:\n\n-   **What's the research question?**\n\n-   **What's the theoretical framework?**\n\n-   **What's the empirical design?**\n\n-   **What's are the main results?**\n\n-   **What's the research question?** Ferwerda and Miller (F&M or \"the authors\" henceforth) are interested in what type of foreign rule generates resistance.\n\n-   **What's the theoretical framework?** The authors argue that different theories in international relations generate different predictions for different types of foreign rule. Some suggest it shouldn't matter--instead the relative coercive power of the foreign rulers is the primary factor for determining the degree of local resistance. Others argue that devolving power to native authorities may weaken resistance, either by producing more effective counter insurgencies or dampening nationalist reactions to foreign rule. Evaluating these competing theories is complicated by the fact that the type of foreign rule imposed is not random but instead a function of a number of strategic factors that would complicate comparisons between instances of different types of rule--since typically we only observe one type of foreign rule or another.\n\n-   **What's the empirical design?** F&M take advantage of a unique situation that existed in France during the German occupation in WWII, where the north of France was governed by the Germans while the South of France was subject to rule by the local Vichy government. The key feature of this that the dividing line between these types of rule at the local level, appears to be plausibly random. They write:\n\n> \\[T\\]he line was demonstrably arbitrary at the local level. Seemingly blind to existing boundaries, the demarcation line cut across political units such as departments, cantons, and communes as well as geographic features such as mountain ranges and rivers. As a result, the assignment of a commune to either the German or the Vichy zone in areas close to the line may be plausibly viewed as quasi-random.\n\nThis claim is key because it allows them to argue that any differences in rates of resistance events on one side of the line compared to another are due to the type of government in those communes (the primary unit of analysis in this study) and not other factors (like the number of targets or the ruggedness of the terrain).\n\nFerwerda and Miller propose a regression discontinuity design to test theories about what types of political devolution lead to resistance to foreign rule. The estimand (target of inference, thing they're trying to estimate) for this identification strategy is\n\n$$\n\\tau = \\lim_{z\\downarrow c} E[Y_{i,D=1}|X_i\\leq z]-\\lim_{z\\uparrow c} E[Y_{i,D=1}|X_i\\geq z]\n$$\n\nF&M's estimand is just the thing that they're interested in estimating. So $\\tau$ represents the difference of the average number of resistance events for communes north of the demarcation line $\\lim_{z\\downarrow c} E[Y_{i,D=1}|X_i\\leq z]$ minus the average in communes just below the line $\\lim_{z\\downarrow c} E[Y_{i,D=1}|X_i\\leq z]$. The $E[...]$ gives us the expected value of the quantity inside the brackets, which we can think of as a mean or average. The $Y$ is just a symbol for the outcome, here resistance events (sabotages or fighting). The $D$ is indicator for the type of denotes communes in the north under German rule. The $|X_i\\leq z$ reflects the fact that these means are conditional on a communes distance to the demarcation line $X$ up to a certain cutoff $z$.\n\n-   **What's are the main results?** They find that devolving governing authority significantly lowered levels of resistance. That is, there were fewer instances of fighting and sabotage in Vichy controlled communes south of the demarcation line compared to communes north of the demarcation line\n\n# Load the replication data and set up your workspace\n\nPlease run the following command to load the data:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load the data\nload(url(\"https://pols2580.paultesta.org/files/data/04_lab.rda\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\nAnd write code to load any packages you think you might need to analyze the data.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Libraries\nlibrary(\"tidyverse\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.4\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.4.4     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.0\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (<http://conflicted.r-lib.org/>) to force all conflicts to become errors\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe next commands tell us a little about the dataset.

The number of \"treated\" communes also varies by department from 83 percent in Charente and 77 percent in Vienne to 34 percent in Saone-et-Loire. This variation in size of departments and the percentage of treated communes has potential implications for the analysis that we'll return to later in the course.\n\n# Describe the study's outcomes of interest and their distributions\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Write your code here\n# Sabotage\nsummary(wrk$s)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n   Min. 1st Qu.

There were a total of 598 unique sabotage events and 595 unique fighting events during this time period in these communes. Both types of events are relatively rare: 85 percent of communes have no sabotage events and 81 have no fighting events. Some communes have a great deal, with the maximum number of sabotage events being 29 and the maximum number of fighting events being 19.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# What is the \"treatment\" in this study?\n\nWhat variable or variables in the data describe treatment status?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Write your code here\ntable(wrk$north)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\n  0   1 \n571 800 \n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntable(wrk$north,wrk$south)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n   \n      0   1\n  0   0 571\n  1 800   0\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Answer:** The treatment is defined as the type of government a commune experienced during the war, defined relative to the demarcation line. Communes north of the demarcation line experienced German occupation (N=800), while communes south of the line were subject to Vichy rule (N=571)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo one of the implications of this design is that a commune's status relative to the demarcation line (and thus type of government/devolution of power) is \"as-if\" random. There's no way to really prove this claim, but we can test some of its observable implications.\n\nSpecifically, if the Germans essentially drew the demarcation line at random (at least relative to the local boundaries of specific communes), then the observable characteristics of communes north of the line (under German occupation) and south of the line (under Vichy rule) should be similar.\n\n# Calculate the means and differences of means for all communes north and south of the demarcation line for the following variables:\n\n-   **distancetotrain**: Distance to nearest train station from center of commune\n-   **communications**: Ordinal variable treated as interval indicating whether a commune had a telephone bureau (3?), a telegraph station (2?), or a post office (1?) or none of these (0?) in 1939\n-   **hectares_scaled**: number of actively farmed hectares as a proxy for forest cover and urbanization\n-   **population**: Population from the 1936 census\n-   **pctright**: Vote shares for the Right from the 1936 national legislative elections\n-   **pctleft**: Vote shares for the Left from the 1936 national legislative elections\n-   **sd_elev250**: The standard deviation of elevation using resampled 250m resolution SRTM elevation data; a proxy for Ruggedness of Terrain\n-   **near_km**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Write your code here\n# You might find something like the following useful\n\n## List of covariates\n# the_vars<-c(\"distancetotrain\",\"communications\",\"hectares_scaled\",\"population\",\n#           \"pctright\",\"pctleft\",\"sd_elev250\",\"near_km\")\n\n## Holders for means\n# north_means<-c()\n# south_means<-c()\n\n# #Replace ???? in code below with some useful logical statement\n# for(i in the_vars){\n#      print(paste(\"Now summarizing\",i))\n#     north_means[i]<-mean(wrk[????,i])\n#     south_means[i]<-mean(wrk[????,i])\n# \n#     \n# }\n```\n:::\n\n\n**Answer:**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Write your code here\n\nthe_vars<-c(\"distancetotrain\",\"communications\",\"hectares_scaled\",\"population\",\n            \"pctright\",\"pctleft\",\"sd_elev250\",\"near_km\")\n\nnorth_means<-c()\nsouth_means<-c()\n\nfor(i in the_vars){\n  print(paste(\"Now summarizing\",i))\n    north_means[i]<-mean(wrk[wrk$north==1,i],na.rm=T)\n    south_means[i]<-mean(wrk[wrk$north==0,i],na.rm=T)\n\n    \n}\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"Now summarizing distancetotrain\"\n[1] \"Now summarizing communications\"\n[1] \"Now summarizing hectares_scaled\"\n[1] \"Now summarizing population\"\n[1] \"Now summarizing pctright\"\n[1] \"Now summarizing pctleft\"\n[1] \"Now summarizing sd_elev250\"\n[1] \"Now summarizing near_km\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndiff_means<-north_means-south_means\n```\n:::\n\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nknitr::kable(cbind(north_means,south_means,diff_means))\n```\n\n\n\n|                | north_means| south_means|  diff_means|\n|:---------------|-----------:|-----------:|-----------:|\n|distancetotrain |   4.0037500|   4.2889667|  -0.2852167|\n|communications  |   1.5375000|   1.4956217|   0.0418783|\n|hectares_scaled |  51.2661532|  39.6845843|  11.5815689|\n|population      | 997.4450000| 740.1295972| 257.3154028|\n|pctright        |   0.3969024|   0.2743438|   0.1225586|\n|pctleft         |   0.3930110|   0.5333780|  -0.1403671|\n|sd_elev250      |  20.3176547|  25.5892396|  -5.2715849|\n|near_km         |  23.9157269|  19.8388128|   4.0769140|\n\n\n**Answer:** See above\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo how should we make sense of these differences? Are they substantively large? Do they provide support for or against a claim that the demarcation lines is \"as if\" random?\n\nAnswering these questions has proved difficult, since different variables are measured on different scales, and it's hard to quantify what big is.\n\nLast week, we saw that we could assess these differences relative to a claim about the world (\"i.e. if there were no difference between theses groups, how likely is it that we would a difference as large as we did\").\n\nToday, we'll consider another way of thinking about how big differences are, which is to think about how much the difference might vary.\n\nWe know from our first week on measurement, that things like variance and standard deviations can be used to describe the spread of a random variable's distribution (how much observations tend to vary around their means).\n\nMeans and differences of means are functions of variables, and so we can think about these quantities as having their own distributions and spreads.\n\nSo one way to compare the magnitude of the differences you calcuated above, is to standardize each difference by its standard error -- that is, we could divide each difference by the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of that difference (how much we might expect that difference to vary). Don't worry about the terminology right now--we'll cover these concepts in greater detail later in the course.\n\nFor now, we'll use as a rough rule of thumb, that **standardized differences greater than 2 are \"big,\"** that is, they are unlikely to arise by chance and thus provide evidence against the claim that the demarcation line was drawn as if random.\n\nThe code below **defines a function** to calculate these standardized differences and returns the standardized difference (as well as the means, difference of means, and standard error of that difference) for the `distancetotrain` variable.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstd_diff_fn <- function(x){\n  # inputs\n  # x: the variable we want to calculate a standardized difference of\n  stopifnot(is.character(x))\n  \n  #1.

But having caluclated standardized differences, it looks like the communes north of the demarcation line differ in a number of ways from the communes south of the demarcation line. They tend to have more farmland, larger populations, a greater percentage of people who voted for right-leaning parties in the last election, lower overall elevations. So the claim for the full set of communes seems somewhat unplausible.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHmmm... so using our \"standardized differences bigger than two\" rule of thumb, we became a little bit skeptical about whether the claim of as-if random was justified for the whole sample.\n\nNow we'll explore whether for a subset of the sample, this claims appears more plausible.\n\nSpecifically, we'll look at whether for communes within a narrower window or bandwidth around the demarcation line differences in observed covariates between communes north and south of the line are small, and thus seem consistent with a claim that the line of demarcation is as good as randomly assigned for these communes.\n\nTo do so, we'll modify our `std_diff_fn` and create a new function called `new_std_diff_fn`\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnew_std_diff_fn <- function(x, c = max(wrk$near_km,na.rm=T)){\n  # inputs\n  # x: the variable we want to calculate a standardized difference of\n  # c: the cutoff distance from the borderd\n  stopifnot(is.character(x))\n  stopifnot(is.numeric(c))\n\n  # What's going on here?\n  wrk <- wrk[wrk$near_km <= c,]\n  \n  #1.

For fighting events, we see a difference in the sign of the effect by department. In Charente and Vienne, fighting is more common in Vichy communes, while in Cher and Saone-et-Loire it is more common in German communes.
