Download [R](https://cran.r-project.org/)\n2.  Download [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)\n3.  Open R Studio on your computer\n4.  Create an Quarto Markdown Document (.qmd) in R Studio\n\n-   File \\> New File \\> Quarto Document\n-   Install any requested packages\n\n5.  Render this .Qmd into an html file.\n\n-   Click the render arrow with the needle OR:\n-   Use the hot keys: Mac: `cmd + shift + k` PC: `crtl + shift + k`\n\n6.  Install some additional packages for the course\n\nSpecifically copy and paste the following into the console in R Studio and hit enter:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"rmarkdown\")\ninstall.packages(\"devtools\")\ninstall.packages(\"remotes\")\nremotes::install_github(\"kosukeimai/qss-package\", build_vignettes = TRUE)\nremotes::install_github(\"rstudio/learnr\")\nremotes::install_github(\"rstudio-education/gradethis\")\nremotes::install_github(\"PaulTestaBrown/qsslearnr\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nYou'll need to have the package `rmarkdown` installed for\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nremotes::install_github(\"kosukeimai/qss-package\", build_vignettes = TRUE)\n```\n:::\n\n\nTo work, so make sure you've copied and pasted the code above into your console\n\n> If you have a question or somethings not working, don't hesitate to ask. Please email me at [paul_testa\\@brown.edu](mailto:paul_testa@brown.edu){.email} or come to my office at 111 Thayer St Rm 339.\n\n# Download `R`\n\n-   **Download R here:** <https://cran.r-project.org/>\n    -   Make sure your operating systems are up to date.\n        -   Mac: at least macOS 12 (Monterey) (Latest: macOS Sonoma 14.3 ). Note different versions for Intel vs Apple M1/M2/M3 chips\n        -   PC: It should work on most versions you have installed\n\n![](images/00_r01.png) - Just click yes, on everything the installer asks\n\n![](images/00_r02.png)\n\n# Download RStudio\n\n-   **Download the desktop version of RStudio here:** <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>\n\n-   Scroll down till you get to something like this\n\n![](images/00_r03.png)\n\n-   If you're on a Mac, make sure to **move the RStudio.app into your Applications** folder\n\n![](images/00_r06.png)\n\n# Open R Studio\n\n-   Open your applications folder/start menu and **Open R Studio on your computer.**\n-   There are four \"panes\" in R Studio corresponding to:\n    -   **Source/Text Editor** in the top left is where you'll write your code. Note: This will probably appear minimized when you first open RStudio\n    -   **Console** in the bottom left where you'll run your R code\n    -   **Workspace/Environment** in the top right is a list of what you've done\n    -   **Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer** The bottom right is a collection of panels we'll go over in class.\n\n![](images/00_r07.png)\n\n# Create Your First Quarto Markdown Document\n\n-   Next, create a Quarto Markdown document (.qmd) by clicking **Click File \\> New File \\> Quarto Document**\n\nQuarto Markdown is a file format that allows us to combine `R` code -- which we use to do our statistical analysis -- with [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) -- a lightweight markup language that can turn plain text into all sorts of formats (.pdf, .doc, .html)\n\n![](images/00_qmd_file.png)\n\n-   You can also do this by clicking on the new file icon <svg viewBox=\"0 0 384 512\" style=\"height:1em;position:relative;display:inline-block;top:.1em;\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">  <path d=\"M369.9 97.9L286 14C277 5 264.8-.1 252.1-.1H48C21.5 0 0 21.5 0 48v416c0 26.5 21.5 48 48 48h288c26.5 0 48-21.5 48-48V131.9c0-12.7-5.1-25-14.1-34zM332.1 128H256V51.9l76.1 76.1zM48 464V48h160v104c0 13.3 10.7 24 24 24h104v288H48z\"></path></svg> in the upper left\n\n![](images/00_qmd_icon.png)\n\n-   R Studio may (or may not) give you a pop up telling you you need to install additional packages. Please do so.\n\n-   Once R Studio has finished installing some necessary packages, R Studio should ask you what kind of file you want to make, choose `html` (the default) and fill in things like the title or author if you want.\n\n![](images/00_qmd.png)\n\n# \"Render\" your Quarto Markdown Document to create an HTML file\n\n\\-**Click the render button** in the Source/Text editor on the upper left and see what happens\n\n![](images/00_qmd_knit.png)\n\n-   In a perfect world, you'll get a nice pretty looking html document\n\n![](images/00_qmd_output.png) On you're machine, R turned your `FILENAME.Rmd` (I named mine `test.Rmd`) into `FILNENAME.html`.\n\n![](images/00_files.png)\n\nUnder the hood, it ran some software that ran your R code (stuff in the grey) and combined it with the markdown text (stuff in the white), to produce the final html file. If you click on that file, it will open in your web browser\n\n![](images/00_qmd_browser.png)\n\n# Install packages\n\n-   **RStudio will likely ask you to install a bunch of packages on start up. Please do so. Get a coffee or check your email**\n    -   R will now install a bunch of packages (programs that do specific things). You only have to do this once.\n    -   This may take a while and RStudio may ask you to choose a \"mirror\" (pick any one in the US). It may also give you an error. Don't worry, email me.\n\n## Install the `devtools` and `remotes` packages\n\nThe version of R that you just downloaded is considered base R, which provides you with good but basic statistical computing and graphics powers.\n\nTo get the most out of R, you'll need to install add-on packages, which are user-written to extend/expand your R capabilities.\n\nPackages can live in one of two places:\n\n-   They may be carefully curated by CRAN (which involves a thorough submission and review process), and thus are easy install using `install.packages(\"name_of_package\", dependencies = TRUE)`.\n-   Alternatively, they may be available via the software sharing platform GitHub.\n\nTo download these packages, you first need to install the `devtools` and `remotes` packages.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"rmarkdown\")\ninstall.packages(\"devtools\")\ninstall.packages(\"remotes\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nPlace your cursor in the console (lower left panel), and copy and paste each line of code above. After you've pasted a line, hit `Enter/Return` and R will execute (run) that line of code. So type:\n\n> install.packages(\"devtools\")\n\nHit enter.\n\nThen type\n\n> install.packages(\"remotes\")\n\nAnd hit enter again.\n\nEach time, R will likely spit out some cryptic [red text]{style=\"color: red;\"} as it installs the packages.\n\nWhen it's done, R will you should see a line with a single `>` in the console.\n\nYou should be able to see the newly installed packages by scrolling through or searching the `Packages` pane on the bottom left\n\n![](images/00_packages.png)\n\n## Install Packages for Course\n\nNow we'll use the `intall_github()` function from the `remotes` package, to install some packages we'll use for this course.\n\nAgain, copy and paste each line of code into your console, and hit `Enter/Return` to run that code.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nremotes::install_github(\"kosukeimai/qss-package\", build_vignettes = TRUE)\nremotes::install_github(\"rstudio/learnr\")\nremotes::install_github(\"rstudio-education/gradethis\")\nremotes::install_github(\"PaulTestaBrown/qsslearnr\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe'll go over this during our next meeting so don't worry if this doesn't work\n\nYou will likely be asked to update some existing packages\n\nType `1` in the console and hit `enter`\n\n![](images/00_update.png)\n\nIn particular, we'll be using a version of Matthew Blackwell's [`qsslearnr`](https://github.com/mattblackwell/qsslearnr) as problem sets for this course.\n\nYou can see the available problem sets by running the following code in your console:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlearnr::run_tutorial(package = \"qsslearnr\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nAnd start a tutorial by running:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlearnr::run_tutorial(\"00-intro\", package = \"qsslearnr\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nTo try and explain in words what this code is doing:\n\n-   `learnr::run_tutorial(` Says use the `run_tutorial()` from the `learnr` package\n-   `\"00-intro\"` tells `run_tutorial()` to run the `\"00-intro\"` tutorial\n-   `package = \"qsslearnr\"` tells `run_tutorial()` to look for this tutorial in the `qsslearnr` package.\n\nIf you run this code, you should see the following tutorial show up in the upper right panel:\n\n![](images/00_qss_ps.png)\n\n## Optional: Adding a Tutorial Panel\n\nYou can also add a \"Tutorial\" panel to R Studio.\n\n-   Click on \"Tools \\> Global Options\"\n    -   Alternatively you can use the hotkey combination `cmd + ,` on a Mac `cntrl + ,` ... No Shortcut for PC :(\n\n![](images/00_global.png)\n\n-   Select the `Pain Layout` tab. In the upper right of the four pains, check the box next to `Tutorial`\n-   You may need to close and re-open R Studio. When you do, in the upper right tab you should see:\n\n![](images/00_option_tutorial.png)\n\n## Optional: Adjusting Quarto / R Markdown Display Options\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n2+2\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 4\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis is just personal perference, but while we're changin some global options, I'd recommend\n\n1.  Click on \\`RMarkdown\n2.  Set \"Show In Document Outline\" to \\`All Sections and Chunks\n3.  Uncheck the box that says \"Show Output in line for all R Markdown Documents\"\n\n![](images/00_opt_rmarkdown.png)\n\n## Optional: Don't Save R History\n\nFinally, in the `R General` tab, I'd strongly recommend unchecking the box that says \"Always save R History\"\n\n![](images/00_rdata.png)\n\n\\*\\* Be sure to click OK\\*\\* when you're done updating these settings.\n\n# Summary {.unnumbered}\n\nThis guide has tried to help you get the software we'll be using for this course set up. If everything's gone as planned, you should have:\n\n1.  Downloaded R\n2.  Downloaded R Studio\n3.  Created and compiled your first document using R Markdown\n4.  Installed some packages\n5.  Maybe changed some options in R Studio\n\nBravo! Seriously, this stuff isn't easy, and I really appreciate the time you put in. It will make our subsequent classes more smoothly.\n\nOf course, everything rarely goes as planned. If you got an error or things don't work out. Don't worry. This literally always happens for a multitude of reasons. I promise we'll take care of things in our next class.\n\n##Additional References {-}\n\nIf you simply can't wait to get started, you might explore some of the following\n\n**R:**\n\n-   <http://r4ds.had.co.nz/> R for data science.
