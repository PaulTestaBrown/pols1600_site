Clarifying how you will  measure \"Political Centrism\" (and family size)\n2. Expanding on why family size should predict variation in this outcome\n\n\nA few thoughts on the first question:\n\n- Is political centrism about ideology in general or positions on specific issues?\n  - What variables in the 2020 NES capture these data concepts\n  - Is someone a centrist if they say they're a moderate on a seven-point ideology scale\n  - Is someone a centrist if they choose a 4 on a 7 point policy scale\n  - Is someone who chooses a 3 or 5 closer on that scale closer to being a centrist or than.\n  - Is centrism a matter of kind (centrist, not centrist) or degree (more centrist, less centrist)\n  \n- Similarly for your key predictor  of family size, is it really about havign more children or is it about having children versus not having children.\n\nThere aren't really right answers to this question. Look at how others have measured this concept on settle on your preferred definition. You might also consider multiple definitions (say centrism coded as 0=no, 1=yes) centrism as a scale (average of folded-policy positions). \n\nYou might also think about the mechanism behind this relationship. Is there really an effect of children -- if so should we expect it to be larger for some issues than other issues? For some groups relative other groups. \n\nAs you think about what covariates to control for, think about about  factors that are likely to be associated with both your outcome (centrism) and your predictor (family size). So older people maybe are more likely to have children, and perhaps more likely to hold more centrist (or more extreme views, I don't know it's an interesting empirical question). Similarly, if you're controlling for something like partisanship, think about the reason why partisanship needs to be in the model. Perhaps Dems and Reps differ in their propensity to have childern. Do \n\n# Data/Empirics\n\nAs you've seen in the labs, and as your assignment demonstrates, take time to really know your data. So the family size variable runs from 0 to 4 with 4 being topcoded for 4 or more children. Perhaps you want to distinguish between non-parents, parents, with one child, and parents with multiple children. How could you do that in R?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Package to load NES data\nlibrary(anesr)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.0     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (<http://conflicted.r-lib.org/>) to force all conflicts to become errors\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(labelled)\ndata(\"timeseries_2020\")\n\ndf <- timeseries_2020\n\nget_value_labels(df$V201567)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n             -9.
