# Research Question

Provide a concise summary of your projects core question(s)

---
# Theory 

- Use this section to explain how we should think about how to answer your research question

- What explains variation in your outcome of interest.


---
# Expectations

- Translate your theory into a set of testable empirical implications

---
# Data

- Summarize your data:
  - Source
  - Number of observations
  - Unit of analysis
  - Measures of
    - Outcome(s)
    - Key predictor(s)
    - Covariates(s)
    
---
# Descriptive Data Visualization (Optional)    

- If you've got a really nice figure that illustrates a key feature of your data, put it hear



---
# Design

- Describe your empirical design

- What models will you fit

$$\text{Outcome} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{predictor} + \epsilon$$
- What do your expectations imply for the sign, size and signficance of coefficients?

---
# Results: 

- Describe the results of your analysis

- Report and interpret the coefficients for key predictors from each model. 

- Are they consistent or inconsistent with your expectations

---
# Results: Regression Table (Opitional)

- Possibly include a regression table, or regression table with just the subset of coefficients central to your question

---
# Results: Predicted Values (Opitional)

- If you've got a complicated model (interaction, polynomial, glm), produce a plot of predicted values to help your reader understand the relationship


---
# Conclusion

- Restate your question

- Summarize your answer

- Offer discussion of limitations and directions for future research

---
# Appendix

- Additional slides go here
