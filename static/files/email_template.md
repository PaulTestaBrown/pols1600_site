Hi all,

Just following up with some bookkeeping for the course:

# --- Survey ---

Please take the time complete the class survey 

https://brown.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_8GHAmuPswJfaSyi



# --- Assignment 1: Research Questions ---

The prompt for Assignment 1: Research Questions is now live:

https://pols1600.paultesta.org/files/assignments/A1_research_questions.docx

Essentially, I'll ask you to upload three possible research questions with related discussion that your group could pursue for a final project in the course.

We'll take time in class for Tuesday for you to talk about possible projects.

Your research questions are now due by 5pm on Sunday, March 6, 2022 on Canvas:

# --- Upload Tutorials on Friday ---

Please upload QSS Tutorial 4: Casuality II by 11:59 pm tomorrow. 

You can find the tutorials in upper right panel of R Studio, or open this tutorial by running

learnr::run_tutorial("04-causality2", package = "qsslearnr")

# --- Readings ---


Please read: Chapter 4 of QSS pp. 123-165 for next week.

Ideally you'll have read this before lecture on Tuesday, and definitely by our lab on Thursday.

In lecture next week, we'll explore three common designs for making causal inferences in experimental studies. Then we'll get into the mechanics of how linear regression works.

In our lab next, we'll continue working with the Covid-19 data (for just one or two more weeks), exploring the question of "Red Covid" using linear regression.

And have installed a Cenus API key following the steps described here:
