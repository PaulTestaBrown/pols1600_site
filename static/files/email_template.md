Hi all,

Great job in class today! Just following up with some bookkeeping for the course:

# --- Survey ---

Please take the time complete the class survey (3 questions: likes, dislikes, and something to amuse us):

I know it's a pain to answer surveys every week; and don't feel like you have to write an essay, or anything at all. But your feedback is incredibly helpful in structuring the class.

# --- Lab 2 ---

The comments to Lab 02 are now live on canvas and the course website:

https://pols1600.paultesta.org/labs/02-lab-comments.html

I generally assume that you all read these comments and compare the code you wrote in class to my commented solutions. Particularly if there were portions of lab where you were confused or not quite sure what was going on. Whether you actually do is up to you, but if you want to get better at coding and working with data in R, taking the time to go over these comments at your own pace is a great idea. 


# --- Upload Tutorials on Friday ---

Please upload QSS Tutorial 2: Measurment II by 11:59 pm Friday

You can find the tutorials in upper right panel of R Studio, or open this tutorial by running

learnr::run_tutorial("02-measurement2", package = "qsslearnr")

# --- Readings ---


Please read: Chapter 2 of QSS pp. 32-54 for next week.

Ideally you'll have read this before lecture on Tuesday, and definitely by our lab on Thursday.

Additionally on the page for Week 3 you'll see a link to an article by Broockman and Kalla (2016) (also attached to this email). 

http://pols1600.paultesta.org/files/readings/broockman_kalla_2016.pdf

In lecture next week, we'll familiarize ourselves with the logic of the study's research design and the data used to generate the results you see in the article. 

In our lab next, we'll be replicating a portion of the results of this article, so I encourage you to read, or at least skim the piece (it's only about 4 pages long) and make sure you understand the basic logic of what they did and why they did it through the lens of causal inference.


Have a great weekend, watch some football or commercials in between the sportsball and I'll see you all next week!

Best,
Paul
