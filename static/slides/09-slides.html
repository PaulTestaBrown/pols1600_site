# Review
## Random Variables and Probability Distributions


---
## Probability 

- Probability describes the likelihood of an event happening.

- Statistics uses probability to quantify uncertainty about estimates and hypotheses.

- Three *rules* of probability (**Kolmogorov axioms**)
  - Positivity: $$Pr(A) \geq 0 $$
  - Certainty: $$Pr(\Omega) = 1 $$
  - Additivity: `$$Pr(A \text{ or } B) = Pr(A) + Pr(B)$$` iff A and B are mutually exclusive

---
## Probability 
  
- Two interpretations interpreting probabilities (**Frequentist** and **Bayesian**)
    
- Conditional Probability and Bayes Rule:

`$$Pr(A|B) = \frac{Pr(B|A)Pr(A)}{Pr(B)} = \frac{Pr(B|A)Pr(A)}{Pr(B|A)Pr(A)+Pr(B|A^\complement)Pr(A^\complement)}$$`

---
## Random Variables

- Random variables assign numeric values to each event in an experiment.

  - Mutually exclusive and exhaustive, together cover the entire sample space.

- Discrete random variables take on finite, or [countably infinite](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CountablyInfinite.html) distinct values.

- Continuous variables can take on an uncountably infinite number of values.

---
## Example: Toss Two Coins

- `\(S={TT,TH,HT,HH}\)`

- Let `\(X\)` be the number of heads
    - `\(X(TT)=0\)`
    - `\(X(TH)=1\)`
    - `\(X(HT)=1\)`
    - `\(X(HH)=2\)`

    
---
## Probability Distributions

- Broadly probability distributions provide mathematical descriptions of random variables in terms of the probabilities of events. 

`$$\text{distribution} = \text{list of possible} \textbf{ values} + \text{associated} \textbf{ probabilities}$$`

The can be represented in terms of:

- Probability Mass/Density Functions
  
  - Discrete variables have probability mass functions (PMF)
  
  - Continuous variables have probability density functions (PDF)

- Cumulative Density Functions
  
  - Discrete: Summation of discrete probabilities
    
  - Continuous: Integration over a range of values

---
## Discrete distributions

- **Probability Mass Function (pmf):** `\(f(x)=p(X=x)\)`

  - Assigns probabilities to each unique event such that Kolmogorov Axioms (Positivity, Certainty, and Additivity) still apply 

- **Cumulative Distribution Function (cdf)** `\(F(x_j)=p(X\leq x)=\sum_{i=1}^{j}p(x_i)\)`

  - Sum of the probability mass for events less than or equal to `\(x_j\)`

---
## Example: Toss Two coins

- `\(S={TT,TH,HT,HH}\)`

- Let `\(X\)` be the number of heads
    - `\(X(TT)=0\)`
    - `\(X(TH)=1\)`
    - `\(X(HT)=1\)`
    - `\(X(HH)=2\)`

- `\(f(X=0)=p(X=0)=1/4\)`
- `\(f(X=1)=p(X=1)=1/2\)`
- `\(F(X\leq 1) = p(X \leq 1)= 3/4\)`


---

&lt;img src="09-slides_files/figure-html/coin-1.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Each side has equal probability of occurring (1/6). The probability that you roll a 2 or less P(X&lt;=2) = 1/6 + 1/6 = 1/3


---
## Continuous distributions


- **Probability Density Functions (PDF):** `\(f(x)\)`
    - Assigns probabilities to events in the sample space such that Kolmogorov Axioms still apply 
    - But... since their are an infinite number of values a continuous variable could take, p(X=x)=0, that is, the probability that X takes any one specific value is 0.

- **Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)** `\(F(x)=p(X\leq x)=\int_{-\infty}^{x}f(x)dx\)`
    - Instead of summing up to a specific value (discrete) we integrate over all possible values up to `\(x\)`
    - Probability of having a value less than x


---
## 游불 Integrals

First, a brief aside  on integral calculus:

What's the area of the rectangle? `\(base\times height\)`

&lt;img src="09-slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


---
## 游불 Integrals

How would we find the area under a curve?

&lt;img src="09-slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
## 游불 Integrals

Well suppose we added up the areas of a bunch of rectangles roughly whose height's approximated the height of the curve?

&lt;img src="09-slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Can we do any better? 

---
## 游불 Integrals

Let's make the rectangles smaller

&lt;img src="09-slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

What happens as the width of rectangles get even smaller, approaches 0? Our approximation get's even better:


---
## 游불 Link between PDF and CDF

If 
$$F(x)=p(X\leq x)=\int_{-\infty}^{x}f(x)dx $$

Then by the [fundamental theorem of calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_calculus)

`$$\frac{d}{dx}F(x)=f(x)$$`

In words

- the PDF ($f(x)$) is the derivative (rate of change) of the CDF ($F(X)$)

- the CDF describes the area under the curve defined by f(x) up to x 


---
## Properties of the CDF

- `\(0\leq F(x) \leq 1\)`

- `\(F\)` is non-decreasing and right continuous

- `\(\lim_{x\to-\infty}F(x)=0\)`

- `\(\lim_{x\to\infty}F(x)=1\)`

- For all `\(a,b \in \mathbb{R}\)` s.t. `\(a&lt;b\)`

$$p(a &lt; X \leq b) = F(b)- F(a) = \int_a^b f(x)dx $$

---
## Recall the PMF and CDF of a die

&lt;img src="09-slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
## What's the probability 

- `\(p(X=1)...p(X=6) = 1/6\)`

- `\(p( 2 &lt; X \leq 5) = F(5)-F(2)=5/6-2/6=3/6=1/2\)`


---
## Common Probablity Distirbutions

In this course, we'll use probability distributions to 

- model the data generating process as a function of parameters we can estimate (using Generalized Linear Models)

- perform inference based on asymptotic theory (statements about how statistics would be have as our sample size approached infinity)

---
There are a lot of probability distributions:

&lt;img src="http://www.math.wm.edu/~leemis/chart/UDR/BaseImage.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;




---
Fortunately, the distributions you need to know to really master data science, are probably more something like

&lt;img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/4854/1*szMCjXuMDfKu6L9T9c34wg.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
And the distributions we'll work with the most in this class are an even smaller subset.

- **Bernoulli**: Coinflips with probability of heads, `\(p\)`

- **Uniform**: Coinflip with more than two outcomes

- **Binomial**: Adding up coinflips

- **Poisson**: Counting the total number of events

- **Geometric**: Counting till a specific event occurs 

- **Exponential**: Counting till a specific event occurs in continous time

- **Normal**: 
  - The limit of a Binomial distribution as `\(n\to \infty\)`
  - The [maximum entropy](https://naokishibuya.medium.com/normal-distribution-demystified-933cf72185d2) when we only know the mean and variance

- **t**: A finite sample approximation of the normal

- `\(\chi^2\)`: Distribution of sums of squared variables from Normal distribution

---
## Bernoulli Random Variables

Let's start with our old friend the coin flip


A coin flip is an example of a **Bernoulli random variable** defined by 1 parameter `\(p\)`, the probability of success. It has a pmf of

`$$f(x) =
    \left\{
        \begin{array}{cc}
                p &amp; \mathrm{if\ } x=1 \\
                1-p &amp; \mathrm{if\ } x=0 \\
        \end{array} 
    \right.$$`


And a CDF of 

`$$F(x) =
    \left\{
        \begin{array}{cc}
                0 &amp; \mathrm{if\ } x&lt;1 \\
                1-p &amp; \mathrm{if\ } 0\leq x&lt;1 \\
                1&amp; \mathrm{if\ } x\geq1 \\
        \end{array} 
    \right.$$`

Note that in our coin flip example `\(p=0.5\)` but it need not. Just imagine a weighted coin like the Patriots use at Foxborough

---
## Uniform Distribution

Our fair die examples represent a discrete uniform distribution: multiple outcomes, equally likely. We could even imagine an infinite number of possible outcomes within a range `\([a,b]\)`, the key parameters for a uniform distribution, in which case our case our continuous uniform random variable has a pdf of

`$$f(x) =
    \left\{
        \begin{array}{cc}
                \frac{1}{b-a}&amp; \mathrm{if\ } a \leq x\leq b \\
                0 &amp; \text{otherwise} \\
        \end{array} 
    \right.$$`

And a CDF:

`$$F(x) =
    \left\{
        \begin{array}{cc}
                        0 &amp; x &lt;a \\
                \frac{x-a}{b-a}&amp; \mathrm{if\ } a \leq x &lt; b \\
                1 &amp; x \geq b \\
        \end{array} 
    \right.$$`

We won't run into uniform distributions all that often except in examples like rolling a fair sided die, but often they're used in Bayesian analysis as a form of uninformative prior.

---
## Binomial Distributions

The binomial distribution may be thought of as the sum of outcomes of things that follow a Bernoulli distribution. Toss a fair coin 20 times; how many times does it come up heads? This count is an outcome that follows the binomial distribution.

The key parameters are the number of trials `\(n\)` and the probability of success for each trial `\(p\)` and the pdf of a binomial distribution is:

`$$f(x)=\binom{n}{x}p^x (1-p) ^{1-x} \ \text{for x 0,1,2},\dots n$$`
So if we were to toss a fair coin 20 times and count up the number of heads, the most common outcome would be 10 heads

---

&lt;img src="09-slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

The binomial distribution will come in handy when trying to model binary outcomes. 

---
## Poisson Distributions

What would happen if you let the `\(n\)` in a binomial distribution go to infinity and `\(p\)` go to 0 so that `\(np\)` stayed the same. A Poisson distribution is what would happen. We use Poisson and negative binomial distributions to describe counts using the parameter `\(\lambda\)` which represents rate at which events occur.


`$$f(x)=\frac{\lambda^x}{x!}e^{-\lambda}$$`

We use these distributions to try and predict to predict the [probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time.](https://towardsdatascience.com/poisson-distribution-intuition-and-derivation-1059aeab90d) Things like how many acts of political participation would a voter engage in over a year.

---

&lt;img src="09-slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;



---
## Geometric Distributions

What if we wanted to know the number times a coin came up tails before heads occurred? This discrete random variable follows a geometric distribution:

`$$f(x)=p(1-p) ^{x}$$`

Geometric and related distributions are useful for describing the time until an event occurs


---

&lt;img src="09-slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
## Exponential Distributions

Taking a geometric distribution to its limit, you arrive at the continuous exponential distribution, again described by a `\(\lambda = \frac{1}{\beta}\)` rate parameter

`$$f(x)=\frac{1}{\beta}\exp\left[-x/\beta\right]$$`

[Cioffa-Revilla (1984)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1963367) uses an exponential distribution to model the stability of Italian governments.

---

&lt;img src="09-slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


---
## Normal Distribution

Finally, there's the distribution so ubiquitous we called it normal. The Normal distribution is defined by two parameters: a location parameter `\(\mu\)` that determines the center of a distribution and a scale parameter `\(\sigma^2\)` that determines the spread of a distribution

`$$f(x)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}\exp \left[
-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}(x-\mu)^2
\right]$$`

---
Standard normal: `\(X \sim N(\mu =0,\sigma^2=1)\)`

&lt;img src="09-slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


---
- As we'll see normal distributions tend to arise when ever you're summing variables. 

- That is sum together a bunch of values from almost any distribution and the **distribution of their sums** tends to follow a normal distribution. 

- Since lots of our statistics involve summation, lots of our statistics will tend to follow normal distributions in their limit (in finite samples like the world we live in they may follow related distributions like the t-distribution, but more on that later.)


---
Consider a binomial distribution with N=100 and p=.5. 

The pmf of this variable (black lollipops) follows a distribution that's closely approximated by a normal distribution (red line) with a mean 50 and a standard deviation of 5.

A relationship explained more generally by the Central Limit Theorem, which we'll cover next week.

---
&lt;img src="09-slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;



---
### What's the `\(p(X \leq 0)\)` for a normal distirbution with mean 0 and sd 1

Since the normal distribution is so common, it's useful to get practice working with it's pdf and cdf.

Consider the following question: If X is normally distributed variable with `\(\mu=0\)` and `\(\sigma=1\)`, what's the probability that X is less than 0  `\(p(X\leq0)=?\)` We could solve:

`$$\int_{-\infty}^{0}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma}e^{-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^2}dx=0.5$$`



---
But R's `pnorm()` function will quickly tell us

- `\(p(X\leq0)=\)` 0.5

And we can visualize this as follows:

---
&lt;img src="09-slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
Consider some other questions?

- `\(p(X=0)=0\)`
  - The probability that a continuous variable is exactly some value is always 0.
- `\(p(X&lt;0)=0.5\)`
- `\(p(-1&lt; X&lt; 1)\)`
- `\(p(-2&lt; X&lt; 2)\)`

---
### p(-1 &lt; X &lt;  1)


- `\(p(-1&lt; X&lt; 1)=pr(X&lt;1)-pr(X&lt;-1)\)` 

`$$\int_{-1}^{1}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma}e^{-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^2}dx=0.841-0.158=0.682$$`


&lt;img src="09-slides_files/figure-html/norm1sd-1.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
### p(-2 &lt; X &lt; 2)

- `\(p(-2&lt; X\leq 2)=\)` 0.9544997

&lt;img src="09-slides_files/figure-html/norm2sd-1.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

We'll use the fact that close 95 of the observations of a standard normal variable will be within 2 standard deviations of the the mean of 0 for assessing whether a given statistic is likely to have arisen if the true value of that statistic were 0.



---
## Expected Value

A (probability) weighted average of the possible outcomes of a random variable, often labeled `\(\mu\)` 

Discrete:

`$$\mu_X=E(X)=\sum xp(x)$$`

Continuous

`$$\mu_X=E(X)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}xf(x) dx$$`

---
## What's the expected value of a 1 roll of fair die?

`$$\begin{align*}
E(X)&amp;=\sum_{i=1}^{6}x_ip(x_i)\\
     &amp;=1/6\times(1+2+3+4+5+6)\\
     &amp;= 21/6\\
     &amp;=3.5
\end{align*}$$`

---
## Properties of Expected Values

- `\(E(c)=c\)`

- `\(E(a+bX)=a+bE[X]\)`

- `\(E[E[X]]=X\)`

- `\(E[E[Y|X]]=E[Y]\)`

- `\(E[g(X)]=\int_{-\infty}^\infty g(x)f(x)dx\)`

- `\(E[g(X_1)+\dots+g(X_n)]=E[g(X_1)]+\dots E[g(X_n)\)`

- `\(E[XY]=E[X]E[Y]\)` if `\(X\)` and `\(Y\)` are independent

---
## Variance

If `\(X\)` has a finite mean `\(E[X]=\mu\)`, the `\(E[(X-\mu)^2]\)` is finite and called the variance of `\(X\)` which we write as `\(\sigma^2\)` or `\(Var[X]\)`.

Note:

`$$\begin{align*}
\sigma^2=E[(X-\mu)^2]&amp;=E[(X^2-2\mu X+\mu^2)]\\
&amp;= E[X^2]-2\mu E[X]+\mu^2\\
&amp;= E[X^2]-2\mu^2+\mu^2\\
&amp;= E[X^2]-\mu^2\\
&amp;= E[X^2]-E[X]^2
\end{align*}$$`

- "The variance of X is equal to the expected value of X-squared, minus the square of X's expected value."
- `\(\sigma^2=E[X^2]-E[X]^2\)` is a useful identity in proofs and derivations

---
## Variance and Standard Deviations

We often think of variances `\(Var[X]\)` as describing the spread of a distribution

`$$\sigma^2=Var[X]=E[(X-E[X])^2]=E(X^2)-E(X)^2$$`

A standard deviation is just the square root of the variance

`$$\sigma=\sqrt{Var[X]}$$`

---
## Covariance

Covariance measures the degree to which two random variables vary together. 

- `\(Cov[X,Y] \to +\)` An increase in `\(X\)` tends to be larger than its mean when `\(Y\)` is larger than its mean

`$$Cov[X,Y]=E[(X-E[X])(Y-E[Y])]=E[XY]-E[X]E[Y]$$`

---
## Properties of Variance and Covariance

- `\(Cov[X,Y]=E[XY]-E[X]E[Y]\)`

- `\(Var[X]=E[X^2]-(E[X])^2\)`

- `\(Var[X|Y]=E[X^2|Y]-(E[X|Y])^2\)`

- `\(Cov[X,Y]=Cov[X,E[Y|X]]\)`

- `\(Var[X+Y]=Var[X]+Var[Y]+2Cov[X,Y]\)`

- `\(Var[Y]=Var[E[Y|X]]+E[Var[Y|X]]\)`


---
## Correlation

- The correlation between `\(X\)` and `\(Y\)` is simply the covariance of `\(X\)` and `\(Y\)` divided by the standard deviation of each.

`$$\rho=\frac{Cov[X,Y]}{\sigma_X\sigma_Y}$$`

- Normalize covariance to a scale that runs between [-1,1]

# The Law of Large Numbers

---
## The Law of Large Numbers (Intuitive)

Suppose we wanted to know the average height of our class. 

We could pick someone at random, measure their height and get an estimate. It would be a pretty bad estimate (it would vary a lot from person to person), but it would be an unbiased estimate

How would we improve our estimate?






---
## The Law of Large Numbers (Intuitive)

Suppose we increased our sample size from N=1 to N = 5. 

Now our estimate reflects the average of 5 people's heights as opposed to just 1. Both are are unbiased estimates of the truth, but the N=5 sample has a lower variance. 

--

Now suppose we took a sample of size N = N-1. That is we measured everyone except one person. Our estimate will be quite close to the truth, varying slightly based on the height of the person left out.

--

Finally we took a sample of size N = 24 (e.g. the class size). Since our sample is the population, our estimate will be exactly equal to to the population. Each sample will give us the same "true" value. That is, it wil not vary at all.

--

The idea that as the sample size increases, the distance of a sample mean from the population mean `\(\mu\)` goes to 0 is called the **Law of Large Numbers**


---
## The (Weak) Law of Large Numbers (Formally)

Let `\(X_1, X_2, \dots\)` be independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables with mean `\(\mu\)` and variance `\(\sigma^2\)`. 

Then for every `\(\epsilon&gt;0\)`, as the sample size increases (1), the distance of a sample mean from the population mean `\(\mu\)` (2) goes to 0 (3).


`$$\overbrace{Pr(\left|\frac{X_1+\dots+X_n}{n}-\mu\right| &gt; \epsilon)}^{\text{2. The distance of the sample mean from the truth}} \overbrace{\to 0}^{\text{3. Goes to 0}} \underbrace{\text{ as }n \to \infty}_{\text{1. As the sample size increases}}$$`

Equivalently:

`$$\lim_{n \to \infty} Pr(|\bar{X}_n - \mu| &lt; \epsilon) = 1$$`

## 游눩 Simulating the LLN

Rhe expected value of rolling a die  3.5.

$$ E[X] = \Sigma x_ip(X=x_i) = 1/6 * (1+2+3+4+5+6)$$

In terms of the LLN, think of our sample size as the number of times we roll a die. 

If we rolled the die just once and took the average of our role, we could get a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. which would be pretty far from our expected value of 3.5

If we rolled the die two times and took an average, we could still get an value of 1 or 6 for average, but values closer to our expected value of 3.5, happen more often


```r
# Calculate the average from 2 rows
table(rowMeans(expand.grid(1:6, 1:6)))
```

```

  1 1.5   2 2.5   3 3.5   4 4.5   5 5.5   6 
  1   2   3   4   5   6   5   4   3   2   1 
```


As we increase our sample size (roll the die more times), the LLN says the chance that our sample average is far from the truth `\((p(\left|\frac{X_1+\dots+X_n}{n}-\mu\right| &gt; \epsilon))\)`, gets vanishingly small.

---


```r
die &lt;- 1:6
roll_fn &lt;- function(n) {
  rolls &lt;- data.frame(rolls = sample(die, size = n, replace = TRUE))
  # summarize rolls 
  df &lt;- rolls %&gt;%
    summarise(
    # number of rolls
      n_rolls = n(),
    # number of times 1 was rolled
      ones = sum(rolls == 1),
    # number of times 2 was rolled, etc..
      twos = sum(rolls == 2),
      threes = sum(rolls == 3),
      fours = sum(rolls == 4),
      fives = sum(rolls == 5),
      sixes = sum(rolls == 6),
      # Average of all our rolls
      average =  mean(rolls),
      # Absolute difference between averages and rolls
      abs_error = abs(3.5-average)
    )
  # Return summary df
  df
}
```

---
Then we could use a for-loop to simulate rolling our die once and calculating the average all the way up to rolling our die a 1000 times.


```r
# Holder
sim_df &lt;- NULL

# Set seed
set.seed(123)

for(i in 1:1000){
  sim_df &lt;- rbind(sim_df,
                  roll_fn(i)
  )
}
```

---
With only a few rolls, our average bounces around a lot


```r
head(sim_df)
```

```
  n_rolls ones twos threes fours fives sixes  average abs_error
1       1    0    0      1     0     0     0 3.000000 0.5000000
2       2    0    0      1     0     0     1 4.500000 1.0000000
3       3    0    2      0     0     0     1 3.333333 0.1666667
4       4    0    0      1     1     1     1 4.500000 1.0000000
5       5    1    1      1     0     1     1 3.400000 0.1000000
6       6    3    0      2     1     0     0 2.166667 1.3333333
```

With a lot of rolls, our average is very close to 3.5

```r
tail(sim_df)
```

```
     n_rolls ones twos threes fours fives sixes  average  abs_error
995      995  197  160    151   154   171   162 3.430151 0.06984925

Let's visualize see how our average changes with the number of rolls, using `ggplot()`

## ICYI: Proving the Weak LLN

---
##  Proving the Weak LLN

A proof of the LLN is as follows:

First define `\(U\)` such that its a sample mean for sample of size `\(n\)`

`$$U=\frac{X_1+\dots +X_n}{n}$$`

---
## Proving the Weak LLN

Then show that the sample mean, `\(U\)` is an unbiased estimator of the population mean `\(\mu\)`

`$$\begin{align*}
E[U]&amp;=E[\frac{X_1+\dots +X_n}{n}]=\frac{1}{n}E[X_1+\dots +X_n]\\
&amp;=\frac{n\mu}{n}=\mu
\end{align*}$$`

With a variance

`$$\begin{align*}
Var[U]&amp;=Var[\frac{X_1+\dots +X_n}{n}]=\\
    &amp;=Var[\frac{X_1}{n}]\dots Var[\frac{+X_n}{n}]\\
    &amp;\frac{\sigma^2}{n^2}\dots \frac{\sigma^2}{n^2}\\
    &amp;\frac{n \sigma^2}{n^2}\\
    &amp;\frac{\sigma^2}{n}\\
\end{align*}$$`

That decreases with N.


---
## Proving the Weak LLN

Then, by [Chebyshev's inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev%27s_inequality), a theorem specifying, for a given distribution, the maximum fraction of values that can be some distance from that distribution's mean:

`$$Pr(\left|U-\mu\right| &gt; \epsilon) \leq \frac{\sigma^2}{n\epsilon^2}$$`

Which `\(\to 0\)` as `\(n \to \infty\)`

---
## The Strong Law of Large Numbers

As you may have inferred, there is a weak law of large numbers and a strong law of large numbers.

The weak law of large numbers states that as the sample size increases, the sample mean [converges in probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergence_in_probability) to the population value `\(\mu\)`

`$$\lim_{n \to \infty} Pr(|\bar{X}_n - \mu| &lt; \epsilon) = 1$$`

The strong law of large numbers states that as the sample size increases, the sample mean [converges almost surely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergence_of_random_variables#Almost_sure_convergence) to the population value `\(\mu\)`

`$$\lim_{n \to \infty} Pr(|\bar{X}_n = \mu|) = 1$$`
The [differences in types of convergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers#Differences_between_the_weak_law_and_the_strong_law) won't matter much for us in this course

## The Central Limit Theorem

---

So the LLN tells us that as our sample size grows, an unbiased estimator like the sample average, will get increasingly close to the to the "true" value of the population of mean. 

Iif we took a bunch of samples of the same size and calculated the mean of each sample:

- the distribution of those sample means (*the sampling distribution*) would be centered around the truth (because the estimator is unbiased).
- the width of the distribution (its variance) would decrease as we increased the size of each sample (by the LLN)

The Central Limit Theorem tells us about the shape of that distribution. 


---
## Review: Z-scores and Standardization

Given a R.V. `\(X\)` with mean `\(\mu\)` and standard deviation `\(\sigma\)`, we can define a new R.V. `\(Z\)` as the *standardization* of `\(X\)`:

`$$Z=\frac{X-\mu}{\sigma}$$`

Where Z has `\(\mu=0\)` and `\(\sigma=1\)`.


---
## Notation for the CLT

Next let's define some variables `\(S\)` and `\(\bar{X}\)` that are the sum `\((S)\)` and sample mean `\((\bar{X})\)` of `\(n\)` iid draws of `\(X\)`

Let `\(X_1,X_2,\dots,X_n\)` be independent and identically distributed RVs with mean `\(\mu\)` and standard deviation `\(\sigma\)`. 

Define `\(S_n\)` and `\(\bar{X}_n\)` as follows:

`$$S_n= X_1,X_2,\dots,X_n= \sum_{i=1}^n X_i$$`

`$$\bar{X}=\frac{X_1,X_2,\dots,X_n}{n}= \frac{S_n}{n}$$`


---
## Additional facts for the CLT

We can show that:

`$$\begin{alignat*}{3}
E[S_n]&amp;=n\mu \hspace{2em}Var[S_n]&amp;=n\sigma^2 \hspace{2em} \sigma_S&amp;=\sqrt{n}\sigma\\
E[\bar{X}_n]&amp;=\mu \hspace{2em}Var[\bar{X}_n]&amp;=\frac{\sigma^2}{n} \hspace{2em}\sigma_{\bar{X}}&amp;=\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\\
\end{alignat*}$$`

Basically: the expected value and variance of the sum is just `\(n\)` times the population parameters (the true values for the distribution). 

Since the mean is just the sum divided by the sample size, the expected value of the mean is equal to the population value and the variance and standard deviations of the mean are decreasing in `\(n\)`.

Finally, we can define `\(Z\)` to be a function of either `\(S\)` or `\(\bar{X}\)`

`$$Z_n=\frac{S_n-n\mu}{\sqrt{n}\sigma}=\frac{\bar{X}_n-\mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}$$`

---
## Central Limit Theorem

For a *sufficiently large* `\(n\)`

`$$\begin{align*}
\bar{X_n}&amp;\approx N(\mu,\sigma^2/n) \\ 
\bar{S_n} &amp;\approx N(n\mu,n\sigma^2) \\
\bar{Z_n}&amp;\approx N(0,1) 
\end{align*}$$`

- The distribution of means `\((\bar{X_n})\)` from almost any distribution `\(X\)` is approximately normal (converges in distribution), but with a smaller variance than ($\sigma^2/n$)


- Proof: [Several ways](https://towardsdatascience.com/central-limit-theorem-proofs-actually-working-through-the-math-a994cd582b33), but requires a little more math than is required for this course

---
## CLT: Why it matters

Why is this result so important? 

Well lots of our questions come of the form, how does a typical value of Y vary with X. 

We may not know the true underlying distribution of Y, but we can often approximate the distribution of a typical value of Y `\((E[Y])\)` using a normal distribution. 

---
## Simulating the CLT

For almost any distribution, the distribution of means from a sample of that distribution will converge to some Normal distribution. 

Let's consider a decidedly *non-Normal* [Binomial distribution:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution) with p = 0.2.

The expected value of Binomial Distribution `\(X \sim B(n,p)\)` is `\(E[X] = n*p\)`.

If we were to flip a coin 20 times, whether the probability of heads was 0.2, then the most likely number of heads (the expected value) is 4.

If we were to flip a coin 100 times, whether the probability of heads was 0.2, then the most likely number of heads (the expected value) is 20.

- So we see that our sampling distributions are centered on the truth, and as the sample size increases, the width of the distribution decreases (Law of Large Numbers)

- The shapes of distributions of sample means can be approximated by a Normal Distribution `\(\bar{X} \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2/n)\)`

## ICYI: Maximum Likelihood Estimation

---
# Maximum Likelihood Estimation


The LLN and CLT lie behind many important proofs and theorems in statistics such as **maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)**

Broadly, MLE seeks to find parameters `\(\theta\)` for model of some data generating process (i.e. a probability distribution), that are most probable (i.e. maximize the likelihood) given some data.


---
## 游불 Maximum Likelihood Estimation

Formally, consider `\(n\)` iid random variables `\(X_1, X_2, \ldots X_n\)`. We can then write their **likelihood** as

`$$\mathcal{L}(\theta \mid x_1, x_2, \ldots x_n) = \prod_{i = i}^n f(x_i; \theta)$$`

where `\(f(x_i; \theta)\)` is the density (or mass) function of random variable `\(X_i\)` evaluated at `\(x_i\)` with parameter `\(\theta\)`.

MLE tries to find `\(\hat{\theta}_{MLE}\)` that maximizes `\(\mathcal{L}(\theta \mid X)\)`


---
## 游불 Properties of Maximum Likelihood Estimators

MLE Estimators are 

- **Functionally Invariant** (The "Plug in Principle")
    - If `\(\hat{\theta}\)` is the MLE of `\(\theta\)` than then the MLE of some function of `\(\theta\)`, `\(f(\theta)\)` is `\(f(\hat\theta_{MLE})\)`
    - If we have the MLE of the variance, the square root of this will give us the MLE of the standard deviation
- **Consistent** (by the LLN)
  - `\(\hat\theta_{MLE}\)` collapses to a spike over `\(\theta\)` as `\(n \to \infty\)`
- **Asympotically Normal** (by the CLT)
  - A `\(n \to \infty\)` the sampling distribution of `\(\hat\theta_{MLE}\)` becomes Normally distributed
  - Makes calculating quantities for inference easy
- **Asympotically Efficient**
  - As `\(n \to \infty\)`, `\(\hat\theta_{MLE}\)` tends to be the estimator with the lowest error

# Generalized Linear Models

---
## Generalized Linear Models

- OLS provides a linear estimate to the conditional mean function

--

- If the conditional mean function is linear and the errors are normally distributed, OLS is the MLE.

--

- What if the conditional mean function is non-linear?

--

- Sometimes we can transform the mean function so that it is linear, and estimate a generalized linear model (GLM) using MLE

--

- Using a GLM often produces more "reasonable" estimates, and can make more efficient use of the data, although there are many cases where a linear estimate to conditional mean function works just fine (or better)

---
## MLE and Generalized Linear Models

We can think some variable `\(y\)` as having a distribution `\(f\)` that contains both a stochastic (random) and systematic components

`$$\begin{aligned}
\text{Stochastic:    }&amp;&amp; y \sim f(\mu,\alpha)\\
\text{Systematic:    }&amp;&amp;\mu = g(X\beta)
\end{aligned}$$`

---
## MLE and Generalized Linear Models

In the past we've described the process of modeling `\(y\)` using a linear regression:

`$$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \epsilon$$`


and with multiple predictors:

`$$y = X\beta + \epsilon$$`

---
## MLE and Generalized Linear Models

We haven't really talked about the distribution of `\(\epsilon\)`, in part because OLS doesn't require any distributional assumptions to be unbiased.

But if we assumed `\(\epsilon\)` are normally distributed, with mean 0 and variance `\(\sigma^2\)`

`$$\epsilon \sim f_\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2)$$` 

Then we could write our model for `\(y\)` as follows:

`$$\begin{aligned} y &amp;\sim f_{\mathcal{N}}(\mu,\sigma^2)\\
\mu &amp;= X\beta\end{aligned}$$`

Where the systematic component of why is modeled by `\(X\beta\)` (i.e. g() is the identity function), with errors that are Normally distributed. 

The `\(\beta\)`s that OLS estimates turn out to be the same values that would get by maximizing the likelihood of this function, given our data, `\(X\)`, assuming normally distributed errors.

---
## Generalized Linear Models


**But what if our outcome doesn't follow a normal distribution?**


Say for example, we have a binary outcome,that we think follows a Bernoulli distribution with `\(\pi\)` probability of success. 

We could model the *systematic* portion of this using the [logistic function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function), `\(g()\)`

`$$\begin{aligned}y &amp;\sim f_{Bern}(\pi)\\
\pi &amp;= \frac{1}{1+\exp(-{X\beta})}\end{aligned}$$`

Again, we could estimate `\(\beta\)` using the MLE to fit a logistic regression.


---
## MLE and Generalized Linear Models

Or if we had a count variable, we might use a Poisson distribution:

`$$\begin{aligned}y &amp;\sim f_{Pois}(\lambda)\\
\lambda &amp;= \exp(X\beta)\end{aligned}$$`

Again estimating `\(\beta\)` using MLE.

In this class, we'll let R handle mechanics of actually fitting these models,
and instead focus on interpreting their substantive differences


---
## OLS vs Logistic Regression


One situation where we'd use MLE is the case of binary responses variable coded using `\(0\)` and `\(1\)`. 

In practice, these `\(0\)` and `\(1\)`s will code for two classes such as yes/no, non-voter/voter,, etc.

How should we model this relationship?

We could use OLS to produce a linear estimate of the conditional mean function `\((\text{E}[Y \mid {\bf X} = {\bf x}])\)`, by finding `\(\beta\)`s that minimize the sum of squared errors

Or

We could use a logistic regression, to produce a linear estimate of the "log-odds" of the conditional mean function of our binary variable by finding `\(\beta\)`s that maximize the likelihood of this function.

---

Let's simulate data from the following model:

`$$\log\left(\frac{p({\bf x})}{1 - p({\bf x})}\right) = -2 + 3 x$$`

We'll codify this into a function:


```r
sim_logistic_data = function(sample_size = 25, beta_0 = -2, beta_1 = 3) {
  x = rnorm(n = sample_size)
  eta = beta_0 + beta_1 * x
  p = 1 / (1 + exp(-eta))
  y = rbinom(n = sample_size, size = 1, prob = p)
  data.frame(y, x)
}
```

---
And use it to generate some data


```r
set.seed(1)
example_data = sim_logistic_data()
head(example_data)
```

```
  y          x
1 0 -0.6264538
2 1  0.1836433
3 0 -0.8356286
4 1  1.5952808
5 0  0.3295078
6 0 -0.8204684
```

---
After simulating a dataset, we'll then fit both ordinary linear regression and logistic regression.



```r
# ordinary linear regression
fit_lm  = lm(y ~ x, data = example_data)
# logistic regression
fit_glm = glm(y ~ x, data = example_data, family = binomial)
```

Notice that the syntax is extremely similar. What's changed?

- `lm()` has become `glm()`
- We've added `family = binomial` argument

Making predictions with an object of type  `glm` is slightly different than making predictions after fitting with `lm()`. 

In the case of logistic regression, with `family = binomial`, we have:

| `type`             | Returned |
|--------------------|----------|
| `"link"` [default] | `\(\hat{\eta}({\bf x}) = \log\left(\frac{\hat{p}({\bf x})}{1 - \hat{p}({\bf x})}\right)\)` |
| `"response"`       | `\(\hat{p}({\bf x})\)`                                                                     |

That is, `type = "link"` will get you the **log odds**, while `type = "response"` will return `\(P[Y = 1 \mid {\bf X} = {\bf x}]\)` for each observation.

---


```r
plot(y ~ x, data = example_data, 
     pch = 20, ylab = "Estimated Probability", 
     main = "Ordinary vs Logistic Regression")
abline(fit_lm, col = "darkorange")
curve(predict(fit_glm, data.frame(x), type = "response"), 
      add = TRUE, col = "dodgerblue", lty = 2)
legend("topleft", c("Ordinary", "Logistic", "Data"), lty = c(1, 2, 0), 
       pch = c(NA, NA, 20), lwd = 2, col = c("darkorange", "dodgerblue", "black"))
```

## OLS vs Logistic Regression

- OLS produces impossible predictions

- The coefficients from logistic regression aren't directly interpertable `\(\to\)` need predicted values.
  - Can also calculate things like [odds-ratios](https://stats.oarc.ucla.edu/other/mult-pkg/faq/general/faq-how-do-i-interpret-odds-ratios-in-logistic-regression/) but I find this convoluted.

- The marginal effect of `\(X\)` varies in a logistic regression

## Interpreting Logistic Regression Coefficients

Our estimated model is then:

`$$\log\left(\frac{\hat{p}({\bf x})}{1 - \hat{p}({\bf x})}\right) = -2.3 + 3.7 x$$`

Because we're not directly estimating the mean, but instead a function of the mean, we need to be careful with our interpretation of `\(\hat{\beta}_1 = 3.7\)`. 

This means that, for a one unit increase in `\(x\)`, the log odds change (in this case increase) by `\(3.7\)`. Also, since `\(\hat{\beta}_1\)` is positive, as we increase `\(x\)` we also increase `\(p({\bf x})\)`. 

---

For example, we have:

`$$\hat{P}[Y = 1 \mid X = -0.5] = \frac{e^{-2.3 + 3.7 \cdot (-0.5)}}{1 + e^{-2.3 + 3.7 \cdot (-0.5)}} \approx 0.016$$`


```r
predict(fit_glm, newdata = data.frame(x=-0.5), type = "response")
```

```
         1 
0.01567416 
```


`$$\hat{P}[Y = 1 \mid X = 0] = \frac{e^{-2.3 + 3.7 \cdot (0)}}{1 + e^{-2.3 + 3.7 \cdot (0)}} \approx 0.09$$`

```r
predict(fit_glm, newdata = data.frame(x=0), type = "response")
```

```
         1 
0.09016056 
```

`$$\hat{P}[Y = 1 \mid X = 1] = \frac{e^{-2.3 + 3.7 \cdot (1)}}{1 + e^{-2.3 + 3.7 \cdot (1)}} \approx 0.38$$`


```r
predict(fit_glm, newdata = data.frame(x=.5), type = "response")
```

```
        1 
0.3814476 
```

## Summary

- The Law of Large Number's says that as our sample size increases, our sample mean will converge to the  population value

- The Central Limit Theorem says that the distribution of those sample means will follow a normal distribution 

- Generalized Linear Models allow us to more accurately model different types of data-generating processes using Maxium Likelihood Estimation.
