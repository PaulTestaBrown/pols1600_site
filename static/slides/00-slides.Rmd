## What you will learn

You will learn 

--

- how to think like a social scientist

--

--

- how to use data to make descriptive, predictive, and causal claims

--

--

---
## R Studio

![](../labs/images/00_r07.png)

---
## R Markdown

- Code in chunks:
	
    ```{r simulate_data}
    x <- rnorm(100)
    y <- 2*x + rnorm(100)
    ```
    
- Write up in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/)

## How to Read Imai

- Active reading
- Copy and run the code in the text. To do so, do the following:

```{r}
if (!require("devtools")){
  install.packages("devtools")
  }
library("devtools")
install_github("kosukeimai/qss-package",  
               build_vignettes  =  TRUE)
```

---
## How to Read Imai

Anywhere the text loads data:

```{r, eval=F}
afghan <- read.csv("afgahn.csv")
```

You can do 
```{r}
library("qss")
data("afghan")
summary(afghan$age)
```

---
## Additional Readings

- Occasionally, I will provide additional readings, available on both Canvas and pols1600.paultesta.org

# Assignments


---
## Assignments

You have three types of assignments in this course


- Labs
- Problem sets
- Final Project


---
## Labs

- Each Thursday we will work in groups to complete an in-class lab
- The labs are designed to reinforce and extend concepts from lecture using real world data.

## Labs

- Each month, starting next week, assigned to group of 3. 
	- At least one of you has to bring a laptop class
- Log on to the Canvas, download the classwork
- Open R Studio
- All files submitted as .Rmd or .htmls by the end of class
- No late work
- One question randomly graded
	  + 100% if correct
	  + 85% if incorrect, but you tried
	  + 0% if you did not try
- Comments/Answers posted immediately after class


---
## Problem Sets

- Coding tutorials to reinforce concepts from lecture and textbook. 
- Accessed by running

```{r, eval=F}
learnr::run_tutorial("00-intro", package = "qsslearnr")
```

- Complete the tutorial. Save output as "LASTNAME_TutorialNumber.pdf"
- Upload output to Canvas by Friday by 11:59 pm
- Grades:
  - 100% any upload
  - 0% no upload

---
## Final Project



---
## Your First Assignment:

- Download and install R and R Studio
    - Email meif you have troubles
    - Troubleshoot by Zoom or in-person (111 Thayer Room 339)
- Work through "00-software_setup" before next class.

## My research

- How do we break cycles of inequality when those most affected by injustice are the least likely to participate and those unaffected are the least likely to care?
