class: middle, center

## Goals and Expectations

---

## What you will learn

You will learn 

--

- how to think like a social scientist

--

--

- how to use data to make descriptive, predictive, and causal claims

--

--

- how to quantify uncertainty about these claims

2. You want to do your own research 

--

--
3. You want to get a job / go to grad school

--

--
4. You *have* to

## How to Read Imai

- Active reading
- Copy and run the code in the text. To do so, do the following:

```{r}
if (!require("devtools")){
  install.packages("devtools")
  }
library("devtools")
install_github("kosukeimai/qss-package",  
               build_vignettes  =  TRUE)
```

---
## How to Read Imai

Anywhere the text loads data:

```{r, eval=F}
afghan <- read.csv("afgahn.csv")
```

You can do 
```{r}
library("qss")
data("afghan")
summary(afghan$age)
```

---

## Problem Sets

```{r}

```



- The text also contains exercises to help you practice concepts from each chapter. In Chapter 1 you'll see the following:

```{r,eval=F}
if (!require("swirl")){
  install.packages("swirl")}
library(swirl)
install_course_github("kosukeimai", "qss-swirl")
```

- Typing `swirl()` into your console will then guide you through a series of exercises designed to reinfornce concepts from each chapter
    - Never put the `swirl()` command in Rmd file...
    - More on this Friday

---

## How to Read Imai

1. Read each chapter with R Studio Open
2. Run and adapt the code so that you know what's going on
3. Use the swirl() exercises for review
4. Work through some of the practice exercises at the end of each chapter.
