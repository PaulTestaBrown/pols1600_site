# Overview

---
## General Plan

- Review
- Lecture consists of a mix of:
  - Topics and concepts
  - Exercises
- Summary

---
## Review

- Data wrangling
- Data visualization

---
## Data transformations


You want to do:

- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 


---
## Data visualization

A basic graphic requires at minimum:

- `data:` the dataset containing the variables of interest.
- `aes`: aesthetic attributes of the geometric object. For example, x/y position, color, shape, and size. Aesthetic attributes are mapped to variables in the dataset.
- `geom:` the geometric object in question. This refers to the type of object we can observe in a plot For example: points, lines, and bars.
---
## Data visualization

Basic graphics are made even better with:

- `facets`
- `statistics`
- `coordinates`
- `themes`

## Topics

- Causal inference

- Causal Identification

- A potential outcomes framework causal inference

- A statistical solution to the fundamental problem causal inference

- How to estimate causal effects 


---
## Exercises

1. What kinds questions have causal interpretations?

2. Estimating an average treatment effect with the `resume` data

3. Exploring the data for Broockman and Kalla 2016

# A Potential Outcomes Framework for Causal Inference
## The fundamental problem of causal inference is that, for an individual unit, we only observe one of potentially many potential outcomes $\to$ Individual causal effects are unidentified
