## Define a function to load (and if needed install) packages



```r
ipak &lt;- function(pkg){
    new.pkg &lt;- pkg[!(pkg %in% installed.packages()[, "Package"])]
    if (length(new.pkg)) 
        install.packages(new.pkg, dependencies = TRUE)
    sapply(pkg, require, character.only = TRUE)
}

## What we liked

--

- We liked the lab (or liked it better)

- Working in groups 

- Extensive notes

- Reasonable pacing 

- Real world data

- Mix of substantive and technical questions

I thought I got a better understanding of how all the code fit together.","Being in groups help grasp the information much better. Also the overview at the beginning of class is great.","I enjoyed the lab more than before, because it had an effective mix of copy-pasting and baby code writing.","I liked that lab was more guided. It was nice that we had group check-ins","Math-y explanations, since they have to be learned sooner or later when doing quantitative analysis.","I thought the lab this week was great. I like how we're building up our skills, and pushing a little bit beyond just copying and pasting to understand why we're doing what we're doing","The Lab was fun with our group","I liked the lab! I've been finding myself enjoying the labs more than I thought I would recently. I also liked the Jon Snow joke in lecture.","I enjoyed the lab! I thought joining the two data frames together was cool and was glad we got to practice that","","The lab, although challenging, went well. Working in groups helps when working through \"portals of discovery.\"","I felt like Tuesday lecture went at a pretty good pace!"]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>Likes<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"pageLength":4,"columnDefs":[{"orderable":false,"targets":0}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false,"lengthMenu":[4,10,25,50,100]}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

## What we disliked

--

- Labs still feel rushed (at the end)

- When code breaks it can be hard to fix

- Lecture was a bit confusing/long

- The space

I'm not sure why, but I'll do some review.","When inputting the code chucks changing the place holders from green to blue was confusing.","The statistical concepts continue to haunt me, I think because we pack a lot into lecture.","I guess I just get frustrated when my code is right but doesn‚Äôt work. But I think it just requires patience at this point","Nothing, really. There were times when things wouldn't work or didn't make sense but that just seems part of the learning process.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if there are other people like me who initially struggled with how to take notes &amp; learn in a class like this. It's definitely been an adjustment. I've gotten better about only looking at my computer when I absolutely need to on Tuesday classes. Otherwise I could get distracted.\n\n(This is more of a long-term thing: considering the size of the class, and how much of learning coding is trouble-shooting, I bet having a TA would be helpful for everyone. Even CS courses with smaller class sizes than ours have TAs.)","the lab was pretty long, so not being able to move through the whole thing was a little frustrating, but getting the basic steps done and then being able to play with it later has its pros","I was confused by all the equations in lecture and how they connect to lab/ HW","Although I enjoyed the lab, at some point I received an error in my code and couldn't move on for a while because I couldn't figure out the error - so it was stressful to feel like I was falling behind.","I kind of want to understand the code I‚Äôm writing a little bit more, maybe it would be nice to do exercises where we practice functions a little more","","If you run into difficulty in the lab it can be hard to catch up as the class moves ahead.","I'm still feeling like all the concepts are piling up on each other, but I also know that I'm busy and could probably spend more time reviewing on my own."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>Dislikes<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"pageLength":3,"columnDefs":[{"orderable":false,"targets":0}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false,"lengthMenu":[3,10,25,50,100]}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
