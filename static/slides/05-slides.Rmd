## Merge election data and covid data into single `df`

.pull-left[
- We're going to take our `covid_us` data and **merge** into this data on the 2020 election from `pres2020_df` using the common `state` variable in each data set for a `left_join()` 

- Always check the matches in your joining variable (i.e. `state`)

- Below we see that our recoding of state to title case in created a mismatch

]

.pull-right[
```{r merge_check}
# Should be 51
sum(pres2020_df$state %in% covid_us$state)
# Find the mismatch:
pres2020_df$state[!pres2020_df$state %in% covid_us$state]
# Fix
pres2020_df$state[pres2020_df$state == "District Of Columbia"] <- "District of Columbia"
# Problem Solved
sum(pres2020_df$state %in% covid_us$state)

## Causal Inference

---
## Review: Causal Inference 

- Causal inference is about counterfactual comparisons

--

- Some counterfactuals are easier to imagine or create than others

--

- Randomization solves the fundamental problem of causal inference allowing us to estimate average treatment effects free from selection bias

--

- Randomization is not always possible, desirable, or ethical

--

- Observational designs that try to estimate causal effects need to justify assumptions about conditional independence:

$$
Y_i(1),Y_i(0) \perp D_i |X_i
$$

--

- This assumption goes by many, jargony names: Selection on Observables, Conditional Independence, No unmeasured confounders.

--

- Credibility of this assumption depends less on having a lot of data, and more on how your data were generated.

--

- Observational designs estimate the effect of $D$ conditional on $X$ using covariate adjustment.


---
class:inverse, middle, center
# 🔍
## Covariate Adjustment

---
## Review: Covariate Adjustment

- Covariate adjustment are a set of statistical procedures that allow us to estimate conditional values 
  - $e.g.(E[Y|X=x]), E[Happiness| leetCoder == T]$

- We adjust for covariates to improve our predictions and make credible comparisons
  - $E[\text{New Covid-19 cases}|\text{Face mask policy}]$ vs $E[\text{New Covid-19 cases}|\text{Face mask policy |June 2020 },]$
  - $ATE = E[Y| D = 1] - E[Y | D=0]$

- Three approaches:
  - Subclassification
  - Matching
  - Regression

---
## Subclassification

- Subclassification is a simple way to adjust for a covariate
  
  - Subset the data to include only the values you want ($X=x$, $D=1$, $Interverntion = Treated$) and calculate the quantity of interest (e.g. a conditional mean, `mean(df$income[df$age <30])`)

--

- But what if we want to control for more than one variable? 

- What if our variables aren't categorical like sex, but continuous like height?

--

- **The Curse of Dimensionality** as you attempt to adjust for more covariates (add more dimensions), the space of possible combinations grows exponentially
  
  - Assumption of Common Support likely to be violated $0 < Pr(D_i = 1|X_i) < 1$ 

---
## Matching

- Matching refers to a broad set of procedures that try to recreate what randomization provides: **covariate balance**
  
  - **covariate balance** is a fancy term for saying that in the aggregate, two groups look similar accept on group received the *treatment* $(D=1)$ while another group did not $(D=0)$

--

- There are many ways to try to match observations:
  - **Exact matching:** Find exact matches between treatment and control observations for all covariates $X$. Only works for a few covariates.
  - **Coarsened exact matching:** Find approximate matches within ranges of values for $X$
  - **Matching on summaries of the covariates** calculating  a single measure of the similarility of observations and matching on this summary to produce covariate balance.

--

- Matching:
  - Conceptually appealing (mirrors the logic of an experiment)
  - Technically complex (complicated algorhitms, finicky software) 
  - Only provides balance on **observed covariates**

# Linear Regression
## The Basics

---
## Understanding Linear Regression

- **Conceptual**
  - Simple linear regression estimates "a line of best fit" that summarizes relationships between two variables

$$
y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_i + \epsilon_i
$$

- **Practical**
  - We estimate linear models in R using the `lm()` function
  
```{r, eval=F}
lm(y ~ x, data = df)
```

- *Technical/Definitional*
  - Linear regression chooses $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ to minimize the Sum of Squared Residuals (SSR): 

$$\textrm{Find }\hat{\beta_0},\,\hat{\beta_1} \text{ arg min}_{\beta_0, \beta_1} \sum (y_i-(\beta_0+\beta_1x_i))^2$$

- *Theoretical*
  - Linear regression provides a **linear** estimate of the conditional expectation function (CEF): $E[Y|X]$

---

# 💡  
# Conceptual: Linear Regression
## Linear Regression Provides an Estimate of the Line of Best Fit

---
## Conceptual: Linear Regression 

- Regression is a tool for describing relationships.
  
  - How does some outcome we're interested in tend to change as some predictor of that outcome changes?
  
  - How does economic development vary with democracy?
  
  - How does economic development vary with democracy, adjusting for natural resources like oil and gas

- Formally:

$$
y_i = f(x_i) + \epsilon
$$

  - Y is a function of X plus some error, $\epsilon$

- Linear regression assumes that relationship between an outcome and a predictor can be by a [linear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linearity) function 

$$
y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \epsilon
$$


---
##  Linear Regression and the Line of Best Fit


- The goal of linear regression is to choose coefficients $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$  to summarizes the relationship between $y$ and $x$

$$
y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \epsilon
$$

- To accomplish this we need some sort of criteria. 

- For linear regression, that criteria is minimizing the error between what our model predicts $\hat{y_i} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i$ and what we actually observed $(y_i)$ 

- More on this to come. But first...



---
## Regression Notation

- $y_i$ an **outcome variable** or thing we're trying to explain
  
  - AKA: The dependent variable, The response Variable, The left hand side of the model

- $x_i$ a **predictor variables** or things we think explain variation in our outcome
  
  - AKA: The independent variable, covariates, the right hand side of the model.
  
  - Cap or No Cap: I'll use  $X$ (should be $\mathbf{X}$) to denote a set (matrix) of predictor variables. $y$ vs $Y$ can also have technical distinctions (Sample vs Population, observed value vs Random Variable, ...)

- $\beta$ a set of **unknown parameters** that describe the relationship between our outcome $y_i$ and our predictors $x_i$

- $\epsilon$ the **error term** representing variation in  $y_i$ not explained by our model.


---
## Linear Regression

Let's return to the simple (bivariate) linear regressions we introduced last week:

$$
y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \epsilon
$$

- We call this a bivariate regression, because there are only two variables.

- We call this a linear regression, because $y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i$ is the equation for a line, where:
 
  - $\beta_0$ corresponds to the $y$ intercept, or the model's prediction when $x = 0$.
 
  - $\beta_1$ corresponds to the slope, or how $y$ is predicted to change as $x$ changes.

---
## Linear Regression 
  
- If you find this notation confusing, try plugging in substantive concepts for what $y$ and $x$ represent
- Say we wanted to know how attitudes to transgender people varied with age in the baseline survey from Lab 03.

The generic linear model

$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \epsilon$$

Reflects:

$$\text{Transgender Feeling Thermometer}_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1\text{Age}_i + \epsilon_i$$

---
## Practical: Estimating a Linear Regression

- We estimate linear regressions in `R` using the `lm()` function.
- `lm()` requires two arguments:
  - a `formula` argument of the general form `y ~ x` read as "Y modeled by X" or below "Transgender Feeling Thermometer (`y`) modeled by (`~`) Age (`x`)
  - a `data` argument telling R where to find the variables in the formula
  

```{r lmdata}
load(url("https://pols1600.paultesta.org/files/data/03_lab.rda"))
m1 <- lm(therm_trans_t0 ~ vf_age, data = df)
m1

```

---

The coefficients from `lm()` are saved in object called `m1` 
  
```{r printm1}
m1
```

`m1` actually contains a lot of information

```{r m1info}
names(m1)
m1$coefficients
```

---
## Practical: Interpreting a Linear Regression

We can extract the intercept and slope from this simple bivariate model, using the `coef()` function

```{r m1coef}
# All the coefficients
coef(m1)
# Just the intercept
coef(m1)[1]
# Just the slope
coef(m1)[2]
```

---
## Practical: Interpreting a Linear Regression

The two coefficients from `m1` define a line of best fit, summarizing how feelings toward transgender individuals change with age


$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \epsilon$$

$$\text{Transgender Feeling Thermometer}_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1\text{Age}_i + \epsilon_i$$

$$\text{Transgender Feeling Thermometer}_i = `r round(coef(m1)[1],2)` + `r round(coef(m1)[2],2)` \text{Age}_i + \epsilon_i$$
---
## Practical: Predicted values from a Linear Regression

- Often it's useful for interpretation to obtain predicted values from a regression. 


- To obtain predicted vales $(\hat{y})$, we simply plug in a value for $x$ (In this case, $Age$) and evaluate our equation.

- For example, might we expect attitudes to differ among an 18-year-old college student and their 68-year-old grandparent?

$$\hat{FT}_{x=18} = `r round(coef(m1)[1],2)` + `r round(coef(m1)[2],2)` \times 18  = 59.16$$
$$\hat{FT}_{x=65} = `r round(coef(m1)[1],2)` + `r round(coef(m1)[2],2)` \times 68  = 49.01$$

---
## Practical: Predicted values from a Linear Regression

We could do this by hand

```{r pred_man}
coef(m1)[1] + coef(m1)[2] * 18
coef(m1)[1] + coef(m1)[2] * 68

```

More often we will:

- Make a prediction data frame (called `pred_df` below) with the values of interests
- Use the `predict()` function with our linear model (`m1`) and `pred_df`
- Save the predicted values to our new column in our prediction data frame



---
## Practical: Predicted values from a Linear Regression

```{r pred_df}
# Make prediction data frame
pred_df <- data.frame(
  vf_age = c(18, 68)
)
# Predict FT for 18 and 68 year-olds
predict(m1, newdata = pred_df)

# Save predictions to data frame
pred_df$ft_trans_hat <- predict(m1, newdata = pred_df)
pred_df
```

## Practical: Visualizing Linear Regression

We can visualize simple regression by:

- plotting a scatter plot of the outcome (y-axis) and predictors (x-axis)

- overlaying the line defined by `lm()`

# Technical: Linear Regression
## The Mechanics of Minimizing the Sum of Squared Errors

---
## How did `lm()` choose $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$

--

- P: By minimizing the sum of squared errors, in procedure called Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression

--

- Q: Ok, that's not really that helpful...

  - What's an error?
  - Why would we square and sum them
  - How do we minimize them.

P: Good questions!


---
## What's an error?

An error, $\epsilon_i$ is simply the difference between the observed value of $y_i$ and what our model would predict, $\hat{y_i}$ given some value of $x_i$. So for a model:

$$y_i=\beta_0+\beta_1 x_{i} + \epsilon_i$$

We simply subtract our model's prediction $\beta_0+\beta_1 x_{i}$ from the the observed value, $y_i$

$$\hat{\epsilon_i}=y_i-\hat{y_i}=(Y_i-(\beta_0+\beta_1 x_{i}))$$

To get $\epsilon_i$

---
## Why are we squaring and summing $\epsilon$

There are more mathy reasons for this, but at intuitive level, the Sum of Squared Residuals (SSR)

  - Squaring $\epsilon$ treats positive and negative residuals equally.
  
  - Summing produces single value summarizing our models overall performance.
  
There are other criteria we could use (e.g. minimizing the sum of absolute errors), but SSR has some nice properties


---
## How do we minimize $\sum \epsilon^2$

OLS chooses $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ to minimize $\sum \epsilon^2$, the Sum of Squared Residuals (SSR)

$$\textrm{Find }\hat{\beta_0},\,\hat{\beta_1} \text{ arg min}_{\beta_0, \beta_1} \sum (y_i-(\beta_0+\beta_1x_i))^2$$

---
## How did `lm()` choose $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$

In an intro stats course, we would walk through the process of finding

$$\textrm{Find }\hat{\beta_0},\,\hat{\beta_1} \text{ arg min}_{\beta_0, \beta_1} \sum (y_i-(\beta_0+\beta_1x_i))^2$$
Which involves a little bit of calculus. The big payoff is that 

$$\beta_0 = \bar{y} - \beta_1 \bar{x}$$
And 

$$ \beta_1 = \frac{Cov(x,y)}{Var(x)}$$
Which is never quite the epiphany, I think we think it is...

The following slides walk you through the mechanics of this exercise. We're gonna skip through them in class, but they're there for your reference




---
## How do we minimize $\sum \epsilon^2$

To understand what's going on under the hood, you need a broad understanding of some basic calculus.

The next few slides provide a brief review of derivatives and differential calculus.


---
## Derivatives


The derivative of $f$ at $x$ is its rate of change at $x$

- For a line: the slope
- For a curve: the slope of a line tangent to the curve

You'll see two notations for derivatives:

1. Leibniz notation:

$$
\frac{df}{dx}(x)=\lim_{h\to0}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{(x+h)-x}
$$

2. Lagrange: $f^{\prime}(x)$


---
## Some useful Facts about Derivatives

Derivative of a constant

$$
f^{\prime}(c)=0
$$

Derivative of a line f(x)=2x

$$
f^{\prime}(2x)=2
$$

Derivative of $f(x)=x^2$

$$
f^{\prime}(x^2)=2x
$$

Chain rule: y= f(g(x)). The derivative of y with respect to x is

$$
\frac{d}{dx}(f(g(x)))=f^{\prime}(g(x))g^{\prime}(x)
$$

The derivative of the "outside" times the derivative of the "inside," remembering that the derivative of the outside function is evaluated at the value of the inside function.

## Partial Derivatives

Let $f$ be a function of the variables $(x, \dots, X_n)$. The partial derivative of $f$ with respect to $X_i$ is

$$\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial f(x, \dots, X_n)}{\partial X_i}=\lim_{h\to0}\frac{f(x, \dots X_i+h \dots, X_n)-f(x, \dots X_i \dots, X_n)}{h}
\end{align*}$$

---
## Minimizing the sum of squared errors

Our model

$$y_i =\beta_0+\beta_1x_{i}+\epsilon_i$$

Finds coefficients $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ to to minimize the sum of squared residuals, $\hat{\epsilon}_i$:

$$\begin{aligned}
\sum \hat{\epsilon_i}^2 &= \sum (y_i-\beta_0-\beta_1 x_{i})^2
\end{aligned}$$


---
## Minimizing the sum of squared errors

We solve for $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$, by taking the partial derivatives with respect to $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$, and setting them equal to zero

$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial \sum \hat{\epsilon_i}^2}{\partial \beta_0} &= -2\sum (y_i-\beta_0-\beta_1 x_{i})=0 & f'(-x^2) = -2x\\
\frac{\partial \sum \hat{\epsilon_i}^2}{\partial\beta_1} &= -2\sum (y_i-\beta_0-\beta_1 x_{i})x_{i}=0 & \text{chain rule}
\end{aligned}$$


---
## Solving for $\beta_0$

First, we'll solve for $\beta_0$, by multiplying both sides by -1/2 and distributing the $\sum$:

$$\begin{aligned}
0 &= -2\sum (y_i-\beta_0-\beta_1 x_{i})\\
\sum \beta_0 &= \sum y_i - \sum \beta_1 x_{i}\\
N \beta_0 &= \sum y_i -\sum \beta_1 x_{i}\\
\beta_0 &= \frac{\sum y_i}{N} - \frac{\beta_1 \sum x_{i}}{N}\\
\beta_0 &= \bar{y} - \beta_1 \bar{x}
\end{aligned}$$

---
## Solving for $\beta_1$

Now, we can solve for $\beta_1$ plugging in $\beta_0$.

$$\begin{aligned}
0 &= -2\sum [(y_i-\beta_0-\beta_1 x_{i})x_{i}]\\
0 &= \sum [y_ix_i-(\bar{y} - \beta_1 \bar{x})x_{i}-\beta_1 x_{i}^2]\\
0 &= \sum [y_ix_i-\bar{y}x_{i} + \beta_1 \bar{x}x_{i}-\beta_1 x_{i}^2]
\end{aligned}$$

---
## Solving for $\beta_1$

Now we'll rearrange some terms and pull out an $x_{i}$ to get


$$\begin{aligned}
0 &= \sum [(y_i -\bar{y} + \beta_1 \bar{x}-\beta_1 x_{i})x_{i}]
\end{aligned}$$

Dividing both sides by $x_{i}$ and distributing the summation, we can isolate $\beta_1$

$$\begin{aligned}
\beta_1 \sum (x_{i}-\bar{x}) &= \sum (y_i -\bar{y})
\end{aligned}$$

Dividing by $\sum (x_{i}-\bar{x})$ to get

$$\begin{aligned}
\beta_1  &= \frac{\sum (y_i -\bar{y})}{\sum (x_{i}-\bar{x})}
\end{aligned}$$

---
## Solving for $\beta_1$

Finally, by multiplying by $\frac{(x_{i}-\bar{x})}{(x_{i}-\bar{x})}$ we get

$$\begin{aligned}
\beta_1  &= \frac{\sum (y_i -\bar{y})(x_{i}-\bar{x})}{\sum (\bar{x}-x_{i})^2}
\end{aligned}$$

Which has a nice interpretation: 

$$\begin{aligned}
\beta_1 &= \frac{Cov(x,y)}{Var(x)}
\end{aligned}$$

So the coefficient in a simple linear regression of $Y$ on $X$ is simply the ratio of the covariance between $X$ and $Y$ over the variance of $X$. Neat!

## The Conditional Expectation Function

Of all the functions we could choose to describe the relationship between $Y$ and $X$, 

$$
Y_i = f(X_i) + \epsilon_i
$$

the conditional expectation of $Y$ given $X$ $(E[Y|X])$, has some appealing properties

$$
Y_i = E[Y_i|X_i] + \epsilon
$$

The error, by definition, is uncorrelated with X and $E[\epsilon|X]=0$ 

$$
E[\epsilon|X] = E[Y - E[Y|X]|X]= E[Y|X] - E[Y|X] = 0
$$

Of all the possible functions $g(X)$, we can show that $E[Y_i|X_i] $ is the best predictor in terms of minimizing **mean squared error**

$$
E[ (Y - g(Y))^2] \geq E[(Y - E[Y|X])^2] 
$$

---
## Linear Approximations to the  Conditional Expectation Function

- We can then show (in a different class) that linear regression provides the best linear predictor of the CEF

## What you need to know about Regression

- **Conceptual**
  - Simple linear regression estimates a line of best fit that summarizes relationships between two variables

$$
y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_i + \epsilon_i
$$

- **Practical**
  - We estimate linear models in R using the `lm()` function
  
```{r ols, eval=F}
lm(y ~ x, data = df)
```

- *Technical/Definitional*
  - Linear regression chooses $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ to minimize the Sum of Squared Residuals (SSR): 

$$\textrm{Find }\hat{\beta_0},\,\hat{\beta_1} \text{ arg min}_{\beta_0, \beta_1} \sum (y_i-(\beta_0+\beta_1x_i))^2$$

- *Theoretical*
  - Linear regression provides a **linear** estimate of the conditional expectation function (CEF): $E[Y|X]$

# Three Designs for Causal Inference in Observational Studies


---
## Credible Cauasal Inference in Observational Studies

Subclassification, matching, and regression all require an assumption of selection on observables:

$$
Y_i(1),Y_i(0) \perp D_i |x_i
$$

But how do we know if we've got the right model or we've controlled for the right variables?

--

Typically, we don't

---
## Credible Cauasal Inference in Observational Studies

Instead, social scientists  look for situations where the credibility of

$$
Y_i(1),Y_i(0) \perp D_i |X_i
$$

depends less on how much data you have and much more on how your data were generated.

## London in the Time of Cholera

---
## Motivating Example: What causes Cholera?

- In the 1800s, cholera was thought to be transmitted through the air.

- John Snow (the physician, not the snack), to explore the origins eventunally concluding that cholera was transmitted through living organisms in water.

- Leveraged a **natural experiment** in which one water company in London moved its pipes further upstream (reducing contamination for Lambeth), while other companies kept their pumps serving Southwark and Vauxhall in the same location. 

---
## Notation

Let's adopt a little notation to help us think about the logic of Snow's design:

- $D$: treatment indicator, 1 for treated neighborhoods (Lambeth), 0 for control neighborhoods (Southwark and Vauxhall)

- $T$: period indicator, 1 if post treatment (1854), 0 if pre-treatment (1849).

- $Y_{di}(t)$ the potential outcome of unit $i$ 

  - $Y_{1i}(t)$ the potential outcome of unit $i$ when treated between the two periods 

  - $Y_{0i}(t)$ the potential outcome of unit $i$ when control between the two periods 

---
## Causal Effects

The individual causal effect for unit i at time t is:

$$\tau_{it} = Y_{1i}(t) − Y_{0i}(t)$$

What we observe is 

$$Y_i(t) = Y_{0i}(t)\cdot(1 − D_i(t)) + Y_{1i}(t)\cdot D_i(t)$$

$D$ only equals 1, when $T$ equals 1, so we never observe $Y_0i(1)$ for the treated units. 

In words, we don't know what Lambeth's outcome would have been in the second period, had they not been treated.

---
## Average Treatment on Treated

Our goal is to estimate the average effect of treatment on treated (ATT):


$$\tau_{ATT} = E[Y_{1i}(1) -  Y_{0i}(1)|D=1]$$

That is, what would have happened in Lambeth, had their water company not moved their pipes

---
## Average Treatment on Treated

Our goal is to estimate the average effect of treatment on treated (ATT):

We we can observe is:

|               | Post-Period (T=1)  | Pre-Period (T=0)  |

## Data

Because potential outcomes notation is abstract, let's consider a modified description of the Snow's cholera death data from [Scott Cunningham](https://mixtape.scunning.com/difference-in-differences.html):

```{r choleradat,echo=F}
snow <- tibble(Company = c("Lambeth (D=1)", "Southwark and Vauxhall (D=0"),
               `1854 (T=1)` = c(19,147),
               `1849 (T=0)` = c(85,135)
               )

knitr::kable(snow)

```

---
## How can we estimate the effect of moving pumps upstream?

Recall, our goal is to estimate the effect of the the treatment on the treated:

$$\tau_{ATT} = E[Y_{1i}(1) -  Y_{0i}(1)|D=1]$$

Let's conisder some strategies Snow could take to estimate this quantity:

---
## Before vs after comparisons:

- Snow could have compared Labmeth in 1854 $(E[Y_i(1)|D_i = 1] = 19)$ to Lambeth in 1849 $(E[Y_i(0)|D_i = 1]=85)$, and claimed that moving the pumps upstream led to 66 fewer cholera deaths. 

- This comparison assumes Lambeth's pre-treatment outcomes in 1849 are a good proxy for what its outcomes would have been in 1954 if the pumps hadn't moved ($E[Y_{0i}(1)|D_i = 1]$).

- A skeptic might argue that Lambeth in 1849 $\neq$ Lambeth in 1854


---
## Treatment-Control comparisons in the post period

- Snow could have compared outcomes between Lambeth and S&V in 1954  ($E[Yi(1)|Di = 1] − E[Yi(1)|Di = 0]$), concluding that the change in pump locations led to 128 fewer deaths.

- Here the assumption is that the outcomes in S&V and in 1854 provide a good proxy for what would have happened in Lambeth in 1954 had the pumps not been moved ($E[Y_{0i}(1)|D_i = 1]$)

- Again, our skeptic could argue  Lambeth $\neq$ S&V 

---
## Difference in Differences

To address these concerns, Snow employed what we now call a difference-in-differences design, 

There are two, equivalent ways to view this design. 

$$\underbrace{\{E[Y_{i}(1)|D_{i} = 1] − E[Y_{i}(1)|D_{i} = 0]\}}_{\text{1. Treat-Control |Post }}− \overbrace{\{E[Y_{i}(0)|D_{i} = 1] − E[Y_{i}(0)|D_{i}=0 ]}^{\text{Treated-Control|Pre}}$$

- Difference 1: Average change between Treated and Control  in Post Period
- Difference 2: Average change between Treated and Control  in Pre Period

Which is equivalent to:

$$\underbrace{\{E[Y_{i}(1)|D_{i} = 1] − E[Y_{i}(0)|D_{i} = 1]\}}_{\text{Post - Pre |Treated }}− \overbrace{\{E[Y_{i}(1)|D_{i} = 0] − E[Y_{i}(0)|D_{i}=0 ]}^{\text{Post-Pre|Control}}$$


- Difference 1: Average change between Treated over time
- Difference 2: Average change between Control over time

---
## Difference in Differences


You'll see the DiD design represented both ways, but they produce the same result:

$$
\tau_{ATT} = (19-147) - (85-135) = -78
$$

$$
\tau_{ATT} = (19-85) - (147-135) = -78
$$

---
## Identifying Assumption of a Difference in Differences Design

The key assumption in this design is what's known as the parallel trends assumption: $E[Y_{0i}(1) − Y_{0i}(0)|D_i = 1] = E[Y_{0i}(1) − Y_{0i}(0)|D_i = 0]$ 

- In words: If Lambeth hadn't moved its pumps, it would have followed a similar path as S&V

---
```{r paralleltrends, echo=F, fig.height=4}

snow_g <- tibble(
  Period = c(0,0,3,3,0,3),
  Treatment = c(0,1,0, 1,1,1),
  Line = c(1,1,1,1,2,2),
  Company = c("S&V","Lambeth","S&V","Lambeth","Lambeth (D=0)","Lambeth (D=0)"),
  Deaths = c(135,85,147,19,85,97)
)

snow_g %>%
  ggplot(aes(Period,Deaths,col = Company))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_line()+
  geom_segment(aes(x=3.1,xend=3.1,y=19,yend=147), linetype = 2, col= "gray")+
  annotate(geom="text",x = 3.3,y=125, label = "1",hjust=.5)+
  geom_segment(aes(x=3.2,xend=3.2,y=19,yend=97), linetype = 2,col="gray")+
  annotate(geom="text",x = 3.3,y=55, label = "3",hjust=-.5)+
  geom_segment(aes(x=-.1,xend=-.1,y=85,yend=135), linetype = 2,col="gray")+
  annotate(geom="text",x = -.1,y=120, label = "2",hjust=1.5)+
  xlim(-2,6)+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0,3),labels = c("Pre","Post"))+
  theme_bw() -> snow_p

snow_p


```


Where:

1. $E[Y_{i}(1)|D_{i} = 1] − E[Y_{i}(1)|D_{i} = 0]$
2. $E[Y_{i}(0)|D_{i} = 1] − E[Y_{i}(0)|D_{i}\} = 0]$
3. $E[Y_{1i}(1) − Y_{0i}(1)|D_{i} = 1]$


---
## Summary

- A Difference in Differences (DiD, or diff-in-diff) design combines a pre-post comparison, with a treated and control comparison
  
  - Taking the pre-post difference removes any fixed differences between the units
  
  - Then taking the difference between treated and control differences removes any common differences over time

- The key identifying assumption of a DiD design is the "assumption of parallel trends"
  - Absent treatment, treated and control groups
would see the same changes over time.
  - Hard to prove, possible to test


---
## Extensions and limitations

- DiD easy to estimate with linear regression
- Generalizes to multiple periods and treatment interventions
  - More pre-treatment periods allow you assess "parallel trends" assumption
- Alternative methods 
  - Synthetic control
  - Event Study Designs
- What if you have multiple treatments or treatments that come and go?
  - Panel Matching
  - Generalized Synthetic control

## Logic of the Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) 

- What's the effect of holding elected office in the UK on personal wealth?

- People who win elections differ in many ways from people who lose elections.

- Logic of an RDD: 

  - Just look at the wealth of individuals who either narrowly won or lost elections.

  - Candidates close to 50 percent cutoff (discontinuity) should be more comparable (better counterfactuals)

---

---
## RDD Notation

- $X$ is a **forcing** variable
- Treatment $D$ is a determined by $X$

$$
D_i = 1\{X_i > c\}
$$

- $X$ is the `margin` variable in the example data, and $D=1$ if `margin` is greater than 0 (i.e. the candidate won the election)

- Interested in the differences in the outcome at the threshold

$$\lim_{x \downarrow  c} E[Y_i|X=x] - \lim_{x \uparrow  c} E[Y_i|X=x]$$

---
## Causal Identification with an RDD

If we assume $E[Y_i(0)|X=x]$ and $E[Y_i(1)|X=x]$ are continuous in x, then we can estimate a (local) ATE at the threshold:

$$\begin{align}
ATE_{RDD} &= E[Y(1)-Y(0)|X_i=c] \\
&=  E[Y(1)|X_i=c] -  E[Y(0)|X_i=c]\\
&= \lim_{x \downarrow  c} E[Y_i|X=x] - \lim_{x \uparrow  c} E[Y_i|X=x] \\
\end{align}$$

---
## Continuity Assumption

knitr::include_graphics("https://mixtape.scunning.com/graphics/rdd_simul_ex.jpg")
```

[Cunningham (2022)](https://mixtape.scunning.com/regression-discontinuity.html#continuity-assumption)

---
## Causal Identification with an RDD

- The continuity assumption is a formal way of saying that observations close to the threshold are good counterfactuals for each other

- We can't prove this assumption

- But if it holds, we should observe
 
  - no sorting around the cutoff (no self selection)
 
  - similar distributions of covariates around the cutoff (balance tests)
  
  - no effect of treatment on things measured pre-treatment (placebo tests)

## Instrumental Variables


---
## Instrumental Variables

Instrumental variables are an economists favorite tool for dealing with **omitted variable bias**

- We have some non random treatment whose effects we'd like to assess
- We're worried that these effects are **confounded** by some unobserved, omitted variable, that influences both the treatment and the outcome
- We find an **instrumental variable** that satisfies the following:
  - Randomization
  - Excludability
  - First-stage relatioship
  - Monotonicity
- Allowing us estimate a Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE) using the only the variation in our treatment is **exogenous** (uncorrelated with ommited variables)

## Compliance

With a binary treatment, $D$ and binary instrument $Z$ there are four types of compliance

```{r compliance, echo=F}
comp_tab <- tibble(
  Type = c("Always Takers",
           "Never Takers",
           "Compliers",
           "Defiers"),
   '$D_i(Z=1)$' = c(1,0,1,0),
   '$D_i(Z=0)$' = c(1,0,0,1)
)
kable(comp_tab)
```

- Assuming Monotonicity means there are "No Defiers"

---
## Estimating the Local Average Treatment Effect

If we believe our assumptions of:

- Randomization
- Excludability
- First-stage relationship
- Monotonicity

Then we can estimate Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE) sometimes called the Complier Average Treatment Effect CATE) 

---
## Estimating the Local Average Treatment Effect

It can be [shown](https://www.mattblackwell.org/files/teaching/s10-iv-handout.pdf) that the LATE:

$$LATE = \frac{E[Y|Z=1] - E[Y|Z=0]}{E[D|Z=1]-E[D|Z=0]}= \frac{ATE_{Z\to Y}}{ATE_{Z\to D}}$$

## Example: Earnings and Military Service

Adapted from [Edward Rubin](https://raw.githack.com/edrubin/EC421W19/master/LectureNotes/11InstrumentalVariables/11_instrumental_variables.html#42)

*Example:* If we want to estimate the effect of veteran status on earnings,
$$\begin{align}
  \text{Earnings}_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Veteran}_i + u_i \tag{1}
\end{align}$$

--

We would love to calculate $\color{#e64173}{\text{Earnings}_{1i}} - \color{#6A5ACD}{\text{Earnings}_{0i}}$, but we can't.

--

And OLS will likely be biased for $(1)$ due to selection/omitted-variable bias.

---

## Introductory example

Imagine that we can split veteran status into an exogenous (as-if random, unbiased) part and an endogenous (non-random, biased) part...

--

$$\begin{align}
  \text{Earnings}_i
  &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Veteran}_i + u_i \tag{1} \\
  &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 \left(\text{Veteran}_i^{\text{Exog.}} + \text{Veteran}_i^{\text{Endog.}}\right) + u_i \\
  &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Veteran}_i^{\text{Exog.}} + \underbrace{\beta_1 \text{Veteran}_i^{\text{Endog.}} + u_i}_{w_i} \\
  &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Veteran}_i^{\text{Exog.}} + w_i
\end{align}$$

--

We could use this exogenous variation in veteran status to consistently estimate $\beta_1$.

--

**Q:** What would exogenous variation in veteran status mean?

---

## Introductory example

**Q:** What would exogenous variation in veteran status mean?

--

**A.sub[1]:** Choices to enlist in the military that are essentially random—or at least uncorrelated with omitted variables and the disturbance.

--

**A.sub[2]:** .No selection bias:
$$\begin{align}
  \color{#e64173}{\mathop{E}\left(\text{Earnings}_{0i}\mid\text{Veteran}_i = 1\right)} - \color{#6A5ACD}{\mathop{E}\left( \text{Earnings}_{0i} \mid \text{Veteran}_i = 0 \right)} = 0
\end{align}$$

---
## Instruments

**Q:** How do we isolate this *exogenous variation* in our explanatory variable?
--
<br>**A:** Find an instrument (an instrumental variable).

--

**Q:** What's an instrument?
--
<br>**A:** An **instrument** is a variable that is

1. **correlated** with the **explanatory variable** of interest (*relevant*),
2. **uncorrelated** with the **error** term (*exogenous*).

---

## Instruments


So if we want an instrument $z_i$ for endogenous veteran status in

$$\begin{align}
  \text{Earnings}_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Veteran}_i + u_i
\end{align}$$

1. **Relevant:** $\mathop{\text{Cov}} \left( \text{Veteran}_i,\, z_i \right) \neq 0$
2. **Exogenous:** $\mathop{\text{Cov}} \left( z_i,\, u_i \right) = 0$

---
## Instruments: Relevance

**Relevance:** We need the instrument to cause a change in (correlate with) our endogenous explanatory variable.

We can actually test this requirement using regression and a *t* test.

--

***Example:*** For the veteran status, consider three potential instruments:

.pull-left[
1. Social security number

2. Physical fitness

3. Vietnam War draft
]

--

.pull-right[ 
- **Probably not relevant** uncorrelated with military service

- *Potentially relevant* service may correlate with fitness

- **Relevant** being drafted led to service
]

---


## Instruments: Exogeneity

.hi[Exogeneity:] The instrument to be independent of omitted factors that affect our outcome variable—as good as randomly assigned.

$z_i$ must be uncorrelated with our disturbance $u_i$. .hi[Not testable.]

--

***Example:*** For the .pink[veteran status], consider three potential instruments:

.pull-left[
1. Social security number

2. Physical fitness

3. Vietnam War draft
]

--

.pull-right[ 
- **Exogenous** SSN essentially random

- *Not Exogenous* fitness correlated with many things

- **Exogenous** draft via lottery

## IV Summary

Instrumental variables require a number of assumptions to yield credible causal claims:

- Randomization
- Excludability
- First-stage relationship
- Monotonicity

Estimation and inference of IVs is beyond the scope of this course. 

  - See Edward Rubin's excellent [slides](https://raw.githack.com/edrubin/EC421W19/master/LectureNotes/11InstrumentalVariables/11_instrumental_variables.html#85)
  - And Matt Blackwells [notes](https://www.mattblackwell.org/files/teaching/s10-iv-handout.pdf)

- Understanding the identifying assumptions of IV can help you critique a study (even if the you don't fully understand the math)

## Summary

## What you need to know

- Causal inference in observational and experimental studies is about counterfactual comparisons
- In observational studies, to make causal claims we generally make some  assumption of conditional independence:

$$
Y_i(1),Y_i(0), \perp D_i |X_i
$$

- The credibility of this assumption depends less on the data, and more on how the data were generated.
- **Selection on Observables** is rarely a credible assumption
- Observational designs that produce credible causal inference, leverage aspects of the world that create *natural experiments*
- You should be able to describe the logic and assumptions of common designs in social science 
  - **Difference-in-Differences:** *Parallel Trends* 
  - **Regression Discontinuity:** *Continuity at the cutoff*
  - **Instrumental Variables:** Instruments need to be *Relevant and Exogenous*
