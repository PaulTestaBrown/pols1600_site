## Data and Libraries

This week we'll use the following libraries.


```r
the_packages &lt;- c(
  ## R Markdown
  "tinytex", "kableExtra",
  
  ## Tidyverse
  "tidyverse","lubridate", "forcats", "haven","labelled",
  
  ## Extensions for ggplot
  "ggmap","ggrepel", "ggridges", "ggthemes","ggpubr",
  "GGally",
  
  # Data 
  "COVID19","maps","DT"
)
the_packages
```

```
 [1] "tinytex"    "kableExtra" "tidyverse"  "lubridate"  "forcats"    "haven"      "labelled"   "ggmap"     
 [9] "ggrepel"    "ggridges"   "ggthemes"   "ggpubr"     "GGally"     "COVID19"    "maps"       "DT"        
```

Please run the code above on your machines.

---
## Installing and loading new packages

Next we'll create a function called `ipak` (thanks [Steven](https://gist.github.com/stevenworthington/3178163)) which:

- Takes a list of packages (`pkg`)
- Checks to see if these packages are installed
- Installs any new packages
- Loads all the packages so we can use them


```r
ipak &lt;- function(pkg){
    new.pkg &lt;- pkg[!(pkg %in% installed.packages()[, "Package"])]
    if (length(new.pkg)) 
        install.packages(new.pkg, dependencies = TRUE)
    sapply(pkg, require, character.only = TRUE)
}
```

Again, run this code on your machines

---
## Installing and loading new packages

Finally, let's use `ipak` to install and load `the_packages`

What should we replace `some_function` and `some_input` with to do this?


```r
some_function(some_input)
```


--


```r
ipak(the_packages)
```

```
   tinytex kableExtra  tidyverse  lubridate    forcats      haven   labelled      ggmap    ggrepel   ggridges 
      TRUE       TRUE       TRUE       TRUE       TRUE       TRUE       TRUE       TRUE       TRUE       TRUE 
  ggthemes     ggpubr     GGally    COVID19       maps         DT 
      TRUE       TRUE       TRUE       TRUE       TRUE       TRUE 
```


- `R` may ask you to install a package's dependencies (other packages your your package needs). Try entering the number `1` into your console
- `R` may tell you need to restart `R` Try saying yes. If it doesn't start downloading, say no
- `R` may then ask if you want to compile some packages from source. Type `Y` into your console. If this doesn't work, try again, but this time type `N` when asked

--

Installing packages can be a pain, but it's generally temporary.

---
## pdfs of Tutorials

- To produce a pdf, R needs a version of `\(\LaTeX\)` installed.

- Try the following:


```r
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

- This may work on some computers, but not others.
  - Producing pdfs is nice, but not strictly necessary
  - Come see me when you have time and we'll get it sorted. 

- For now, just export the html file and upload that to canvas

## Loading the Covid-19 Data

Let's load the Covid-19 data we worked with last week:


```r
covid &lt;- COVID19::covid19(
  country = "US",
  level = 2,
  verbose = F
    
)
```

--
While that runs, let's talk about the grammar

## The Grammar of Graphics

Inspired by [Wilkinson (2005)](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/0-387-28695-0)

&gt; A statistical graphic is a mapping of `data` variables to `aes` thetic attributes of `geom` etric objects.

At a minimum, a graphic contains three core components:

- `data:` the dataset containing the variables of interest.
- `aes`: aesthetic attributes of the geometric object. For example, x/y position, color, shape, and size. Aesthetic attributes are mapped to variables in the dataset.
- `geom:` the geometric object in question. This refers to the type of object we can observe in a plot For example: points, lines, and bars.

## The grammar of graphics in R

In R, we'll implement this grammar of graphics using the `ggplot` package

- Let's take a look at your feedback to last week's survey and see how we can visualize some of the in formation you provided

It's also cool to see how we can make the code make data easier/more accessible to us. Currently stuck on the lab, but I think that will be a lot easier in person when I am able to ask questions of you/classmates","I liked learning about how to make the barplot and histogram in the tutorial.  The Lab was also really cool today because it used the Covid data and extracting specific numbers was really quick with the commands.","I like how you remind the class that its expected to not understand everything thats going on. I found the keyboard shortcuts useful as well.","I appreciated having the blank spaces in otherwise filled out code.  It was a good way to get me to think through stuff without having to start from square one on the code.","I thought it was nice using real data.

Not just R syntax but I struggled to keep track of all of the different data file names, object names, variable names, etc. I will probably need to go back through the slides and get a better feel for how the data is organized before I try the lab exercises again.","It was confusing to follow along with the lab on Zoom","Hard to gauge fully because participating from Zoom was definitely an added challenge!!","I think I am still trying to navigate the language of R so I don't always remember specific commands on hand and then I have to either go through the textbook or dig through the slides to find it.  It is still taking me a bit of time but I am slowly getting the hang of it.","I don't really understand what’s going on most of the time, and I am frustrated by the fact that I don’t understand what the purpose of the code is. Being on zoom makes everything harder as well, especially having to have so many windows open at once.","All of it.  It was an excruciatingly painful class.  I kept getting errors, and nothing seemed to work.  I wanted to throw my laptop at the wall at the end of it.  I kept feeling like I was falling behind and unable to catch back up.","I thought we were a little crunched for time.","The fact that class went over time was challenging for me since I have another class right after on the other side of campus.

## Building that figure

1. Look at the raw data
2. Recode the raw data
3. Make a basic plot, telling R the data, aesthetics, geometries, and statistics I want it to plot
4. Tinker with the data and plot's scales, coordinates, labels and theme to make the figure look better


---
## 1. Look at the raw data


```r

# Troubleshooting errors

[XKCD](https://xkcd.com/979)

## Two kinds of errors:

--

- **Syntactic**
  - R doesn't understand how to run your code
  - Most common, easy to fix (eventually...)

--

- **Semantic**
  - R runs your code but doesn't give you the expected result
  - Less common, harder to fix

--

Most errors happen because R is looking for something that isn't there.

More discussion [here](https://github.com/noamross/zero-dependency-problems/blob/master/misc/stack-overflow-common-r-errors.md) and [here](https://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2015/03/the-most-common-r-error-messages.html)

---
## Common Syntactic Errors

- Unmatched parentheses or brackets

- Misspelled a name 

- Forgot a comma

- Forgot to install a package or load a library

- Forgot to set the working directory/path to a file you want R to use.

- Tried to select a column or row that doesn't exist


---
## Fixing Syntactic Errors

- R Studio's script editor will show a red circle with a white x in next to a line of code it thinks has an error in it.

- Have someone else look at your code (Fresh eyes, [paired programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming))

- Copy and paste the "general part" of error message into Google.

- Knit your document after each completed code chunk
  - This will run the code from top to bottom, and stop when it encounters an error
  - Try commenting out the whole chunk, and then uncommenting successive lines of code 

- Be patient. Don't be hard are yourself. Remember, errors are portals of discovery.

---
## Semantic Errors

- Your code runs, but doesn't produce what you expected.
- Less common;  can be harder to identify and fix
- One example: Two packages have a function with the same name that do different things


```r
# dplyr::summarize
# Hmisc::summarize
```

---
## Semantic Errors

- Some general solutions/practices to avoid semantic errors:
  - Specify the package and the function you want: `package_name::function_name()`
  - Write helpful comments in your code.
  - Include "sanity" checks in your code. 
  - If a function should produce an output that's a data.frame, check to see if it is a data frame
  

```r
# Here's some pseudo code:

# I expect my_function produces a data frame
x &lt;- my_function(y) 

# Check to see if x is a data frame
# If x is not a data frame, return an Error
stopifnot(is.data.frame(x))
```

# Data wrangling in R


---
## Why do we need to wrangle data

- Rarely, if ever, do we get data in the exact format we need.

- Instead, before we can get to work, we need to re-shape, re-arrange, and/or reformat our data.

- Sometimes we call this process:
  - Data cleaning, recoding
  - Data wrangling
  - Data carpentry

- The end goal is the same: make messy data tidy

---
## Tidy data

- Every column is a variable.

- Every row is an observation.

- Every cell is a single value.

---
## Tools for transforming our data

Last week we used the following functions:

- `read_csv()` and `data()` to read and load data in R

- logical operators like `&amp;`, `|`, `%in%` `==`, `!=`, `&gt;`,`&gt;=`,`&lt;`,`&lt;=` to make comparisons

- the pipe command `%&gt;%` to "pipe" the output of one function into another

- `filter()` to pick observations (rows) by their values

- `arrange()` to reorder rows

- `select()` to pick variables by their names

- `mutate()` and `case_when()` command to create new variables in our data set

- `summarise()` to collapse many values to a single value (like a mean or median)

- `group_by()` to apply functions like `mutate()` and `summarise()` on a group-by-group basis

---
## Common functions for transforming data

All of these "verb" functions from the `dplyr` package (e.g. `filter()`,`mutate()`) follow a similar format:

1. Their first argument is a data frame
2. The subsequent arguments tell R what to do with the data frame, using the variable names (without quotes)
3. The output is a new data frame

# You trying to get the `%&gt;%`?

---
## The pipe command `%&gt;%`

- The pipe command is way of "chaining" lines of code together, piping the results of one `tidyverse` function into the next function.

- The pipe command works, because these functions always expect a data frame as their first argument, and always produce a data frame as their output.

## Wrangling the Covid-19 data

To work with the Covid-19 data we did the following:

- Subset the data to exclude US Territories
- Created new variables from existing variables in the data

---
## Wrangling the Covid-19 data


Specifically, we did the following:

1. Created an object called `territories` that is a vector containing the names of U.S. territories
2. Created a new dataframe, called `covid_us`, by filtering out observations from the U.S. territories
3. Created a `state` variable that is a copy of the `administrative_area_level_2` 
4. Created a variable called `new_cases` from the `confirmed`. Create a variable called `new_cases_pc` that is the number of new Covid-19 cases per 100,000 citizens
5. Created a variable called `face_masks` from the `facial_coverings` variable. ([slides](hhttps://pols1600.paultesta.org/slides/01-slides#111))

Let's take some time to make sure we understand everything that was happening.

---
## Created an object called `territories` 



```r
# ---- 1. Create territories object

territories &lt;- c(
  "American Samoa",
  "Guam",
  "Northern Mariana Islands",
  "Puerto Rico",
  "Virgin Islands"
  )
```

The territories object is useful because it let's ask R is an observation from a U.S. territory or not

---
## Created a new dataframe, called `covid_us`

- Below, we use the `filter()` command to select only the rows where the `administrative_area_level_2` is not (`!`) in (`%in%`) the `territories` object
- `covid_us` is a subset of the `covid` data.frame with only observations from the 50 States and the District of Columbia


```r
# ---- 2. Create covid_us data frame
# How many rows and columns in covid
dim(covid)
```

```
[1] 40497    47
```

```r
# Filter out obs from US territories
covid_us &lt;- covid %&gt;%
  filter(!administrative_area_level_2 %in% territories)

# covid_us should have fewer rows than covid
dim(covid_us)
```

```
[1] 37001    47
```

---
## Created a new dataframe, called `covid_us`

- We use the `dim()` function to check and make sure that `covid_us` has fewer rows than `covid`


```r
# ---- 2. Create covid_us data frame
# How many rows and columns in covid
dim(covid)
```

```
[1] 40497    47
```

```r
# Filter out obs from US territories
covid_us &lt;- covid %&gt;%
  filter(!administrative_area_level_2 %in% territories)

# covid_us should have fewer rows than covid
dim(covid_us)
```

```
[1] 37001    47
```


---
## Created a variable called `state`

Next we create a new variable called `state`, that is simply a copy of the `administrative_area_level_2` variable, using the `mutate()` function

Note that mutate doesn't save the output. It just returns a data frame:


```r
covid_us %&gt;%
  mutate(
    state = administrative_area_level_2
  )
```

```

## Created a variable called `state`

We need to save the output of `mutate()` function back into an object


```r
dim(covid_us)
```

```
[1] 37001    47
```

```r
covid_us %&gt;%
  mutate(
    state = administrative_area_level_2
  ) -&gt; covid_us
dim(covid_us)
```

```
[1] 37001    48
```

```r
names(covid_us)[48]
```

```
[1] "state"
```

---
## Created a variable called `state`

Now there's a new column in `covid_us` called `state`, that we can access by calling `covid_us$state`


```r
covid_us$state[1:5] # Just show first 5 observations
```

```
[1] "Minnesota" "Minnesota" "Minnesota" "Minnesota" "Minnesota"
```

We could have done the same thing in "Base" R


```r
covid_us$state &lt;- covid_us$administrative_area_level_2
```

Why didn't we?

--
- Consistent preference for `tidyverse` &gt; `base R`
- Saves time when recoding lots of variables
- `mutate()` plays nicely with functions like `group_by()`


---
## Create a variable called `new_cases` from the `confirmed` variable

The `confirmed` variable contains a running total of confirmed cases in a given state on a given day. 

We want to create a new variable that is just the number of new cases for a given day, by taking the current total, and subtracting the prior day's total.

We want to do this separately, for each state.


```r
covid_us %&gt;%
  dplyr::group_by(state) %&gt;%
  mutate(
    new_cases = confirmed - lag(confirmed)
  ) -&gt; covid_us
```

---
## Create a variable called `new_cases` from the `confirmed` variable

The code below helps us see what's happening inside our mutate function, when we group by `state`


```r
covid_us %&gt;%
  filter(date &gt;= "2020-04-01" &amp; date &lt; "2020-04-07")%&gt;%
  group_by(state) %&gt;%
  select(state, date, confirmed)%&gt;%
  mutate(
    confirmed_lag1 = lag(confirmed),
    new_cases = confirmed - lag(confirmed)
  )
```

```
# A tibble: 306 × 5
# Groups:   state [51]
   state      date       confirmed confirmed_lag1 new_cases
   &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;date&gt;         &lt;int&gt;          &lt;int&gt;     &lt;int&gt;

## Create a variable called `new_cases` from the `confirmed` variable

If we hadn't grouped by state, we might calculate the difference between MN and CA


```r
covid_us %&gt;%
  filter(date &gt;= "2020-04-01" &amp; date &lt; "2020-04-07")%&gt;%
  ungroup() %&gt;%
  select(state, date, confirmed)%&gt;%
  mutate(
    confirmed_lag1 = lag(confirmed),
    new_cases = confirmed - lag(confirmed)
  )
```

```
# A tibble: 306 × 5
   state      date       confirmed confirmed_lag1 new_cases
   &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;date&gt;         &lt;int&gt;          &lt;int&gt;     &lt;int&gt;
 1 Minnesota  2020-04-01       689             NA        NA
 2 Minnesota  2020-04-02       742            689        53
 3 Minnesota  2020-04-03       789            742        47
 4 Minnesota  2020-04-04       865            789        76
 5 Minnesota  2020-04-05       935            865        70
 6 Minnesota  2020-04-06       986            935        51
 7 California 2020-04-01      9857            986      8871
 8 California 2020-04-02     11190           9857      1333
 9 California 2020-04-03     12569          11190      1379
10 California 2020-04-04     13796          12569      1227
# … with 296 more rows
```

## Create a variable called `new_cases_pc` 

- Next we scale our `new_cases` variable by the `population` of each state so that it captures the number of new cases per 100,000 residents.
- Note the `,` after `new_cases = confirmed - lag(confirmed),`
  - This tells `mutate()` we're ready to create a new variable
- See how the number of columns `dim(covid_us)` reports keeps increasing.


```r
covid_us %&gt;%
  mutate(
    state = administrative_area_level_2,
  ) %&gt;%
  dplyr::group_by(state) %&gt;%
  mutate(
    new_cases = confirmed - lag(confirmed),
    new_cases_pc = new_cases / population *100000
    ) -&gt;covid_us
dim(covid_us)
```

```
[1] 37001    50
```

---
## Created a variable called `face_masks`

Finally, we want to create a new variable called `face_masks` from the `facial_coverings` variable.

---
## Created a variable called `face_masks`

Recall, that the `facial_coverings` variable took on range of substantive values from 0 to 4

- 0 - No policy
- 1 - Recommended
- 2 - Required in some specified shared/public spaces outside the home with other people present, or some situations when social distancing not possible
- 3 - Required in all shared/public spaces outside the home with other people present or all situations when social distancing not possible
- 4 - Required outside the home at all times regardless of location or presence of other people


```r
table(covid_us$facial_coverings)
```

```

   -4    -3    -2    -1     0     1     2     3     4 
  421  5264  5445    97  2513  2752 10851  8580   622 
```

Where negative values correspond to the most stringent policy in effect in a targeted geographic area (rather than the whole state)


---
## Created a variable called `face_masks`

To transform `facial_coverings` into `face_masks`, we want to do the following:

- Treat positive and negative values the same
- Give numeric values of `facial_coverings` meaningful character labels in  `face_masks`
- Treat these labels as factor, to convey the increasing stringency of the policy

To do this, we'll use the `case_when()` function

---
## Created a variable called `face_masks`



```r
covid_us %&gt;%
mutate(
    face_masks = case_when(
      facial_coverings == 0 ~ "No policy",
      abs(facial_coverings) == 1 ~ "Recommended",
      abs(facial_coverings) == 2 ~ "Some requirements",
      abs(facial_coverings) == 3 ~ "Required shared places",
      abs(facial_coverings) == 4 ~ "Required all times",
    ) %&gt;% factor(.,
      levels = c("No policy","Recommended",
                 "Some requirements",
                 "Required shared places",
                 "Required all times")
    ) 
    ) -&gt; covid_us
```

---
## Created a variable called `face_masks`

To understand what that last chunk of code did, it's helpful to look at the two variables


```r
covid_us%&gt;%
  filter(state == "Illinois", date &gt; "2020-9-28") %&gt;%
  select(facial_coverings, face_masks)
```

```
# A tibble: 497 × 3
# Groups:   state [1]
   state    facial_coverings face_masks        
   &lt;chr&gt;               &lt;int&gt; &lt;fct&gt;             
 1 Illinois                2 Some requirements 
 2 Illinois                2 Some requirements 
 3 Illinois               -4 Required all times
 4 Illinois               -4 Required all times
 5 Illinois               -4 Required all times
 6 Illinois               -4 Required all times
 7 Illinois               -4 Required all times
 8 Illinois               -4 Required all times
 9 Illinois               -4 Required all times
10 Illinois               -4 Required all times
# … with 487 more rows
```


---
## Created a variable called `face_masks`

Again we could have done this in `base` R 


```r
covid_us$face_masks_baseR &lt;- NA
covid_us$face_masks_baseR[covid_us$facial_coverings ==0] &lt;- "No policy"
covid_us$face_masks_baseR[abs(covid_us$facial_coverings)==1] &lt;- "Recommended"
covid_us$face_masks_baseR[abs(covid_us$facial_coverings)==2] &lt;-  "Some requirements"
covid_us$face_masks_baseR[abs(covid_us$facial_coverings)==3] &lt;- "Required shared places"
covid_us$face_masks_baseR[abs(covid_us$facial_coverings)==4] &lt;- "Required all times"
```

---
## Created a variable called `face_masks`

Again we could have done this in `base` R 



```r
covid_us$face_masks_baseR &lt;- factor(covid_us$face_masks_baseR,
                                 levels = c("No policy","Recommended",
                 "Some requirements",
                 "Required shared places",
                 "Required all times")   
                                    )

all.equal(covid_us$face_masks,covid_us$face_masks_baseR)
```

```
[1] TRUE
```

---
## Created a variable called `face_masks`

And gotten the same result


```r
all.equal(covid_us$face_masks,covid_us$face_masks_baseR)
```

```
[1] TRUE
```


```r
# Compare tidy (rows) to base R (columns)
table(covid_us$face_masks,covid_us$face_masks_baseR)
```

```
                        
                         No policy Recommended Some requirements Required shared places Required all times
  No policy                   2513           0                 0                      0                  0
  Recommended                    0        2849                 0                      0                  0
  Some requirements              0           0             16296                      0                  0
  Required shared places         0           0                 0                  13844                  0
  Required all times             0           0                 0                      0               1043
```

The full code looked something like this:


```r
covid_us %&gt;%
  mutate(
    state = administrative_area_level_2,
  ) %&gt;%
  dplyr::group_by(state) %&gt;%
  mutate(
    new_cases = confirmed - lag(confirmed),
    new_cases_pc = new_cases / population *100000
    ) %&gt;%
  mutate(
    face_masks = case_when(
      facial_coverings == 0 ~ "No policy",
      abs(facial_coverings) == 1 ~ "Recommended",
      abs(facial_coverings) == 2 ~ "Some requirements",
      abs(facial_coverings) == 3 ~ "Required shared places",
      abs(facial_coverings) == 4 ~ "Required all times",
    ) %&gt;% factor(.,
      levels = c("No policy","Recommended",
                 "Some requirements",
                 "Required shared places",
                 "Required all times")
    ) 
    ) -&gt; covid_us
```

---
## Further Recoding

In last week's lab, we also added the following


```r
covid_us %&gt;%
  mutate(
    year = year(date),
    month = month(date),
    year_month = paste(year, str_pad(month, width = 2, pad=0), sep = "-"),
    percent_vaccinated = people_fully_vaccinated/population*100  
    ) -&gt; covid_us
```

---
## Working with dates

R treat's dates differently


```r
covid_us$date[1:3]
```

```
[1] "2020-01-01" "2020-01-02" "2020-01-03"
```

```r
class(covid_us$date)
```

```
[1] "Date"
```

If R knows a variable is a date, we can extract components of that date, using functions from the `lubridate` package


```r
year(covid_us$date[1:3])
```

```
[1] 2020 2020 2020
```

```r
month(covid_us$date[1:3])
```

```
[1] 1 1 1
```

---
## The `str_pad()` and `paste()` function

- The `str_pad()` function lets us 'pad' strings so that they're all the same width


```r
month(covid_us$date[1:3])
```

```
[1] 1 1 1
```

```r
str_pad(month(covid_us$date[1:3]), width=2, pad = 0)
```

```
[1] "01" "01" "01"
```

- The `paste` function lets us paste objects together.


```r
paste(year(covid_us$date[1:3]),
      str_pad(month(covid_us$date[1:3]), width=2, pad = 0),
      sep = "-"
      )
```

```
[1] "2020-01" "2020-01" "2020-01"
```

## Concept check

Suppose you want to do the following, what function or functions would you use:

- Read data into `R`
- Look at the data to get a high level overview of its structure
- Subset the data to include just obersvations with certain values
- Select specific columns from data
- Add new columns to the data
- Summarize multiple values by collapsing them into a single value
- Doing some function group-by-group?

## Concept check

Suppose you want to do the following, what function or functions would you use:

- Read data into `R`
  - `read_xxx()` (tidy), `read.xxx()` (base)
- Look at the data to get a high level overview of its structure
  - `head()`, `tail()`, `glimpse()`, `table()`, `summary()`, `View()`
- Subset the data to include just obersvations with certain values
  - `data %&gt;% filter(x &gt; 0)`, `data[data$x &gt; 0]`, `subset(data, x &gt; 0)`
- Select specific columns from data
  - `data$variable`, `data %&gt;% select(variable1, variable2)`, `data[,c("x1","x2")]`
- Add new columns to the data
  - `data %&gt;% mutate(x = y/10)` `data$x &lt;- data$y/10`
- Summarize multiple values by collapsing them into a single value
  - `data %&gt;% summarise(x_mn = mean(x, na.rm=T))`
- Doing some function group-by-group?
  - `data %&gt;% group_by(g) %&gt;% summarise(x_mn = mean(x, na.rm=T))`

## Concept check

Should you know exactly how to do all of this? 

--

**NO! Of course not. For Pete's sake, Paul, It's only the second week**

--

Will you learn how to do much of this?

--

## Advice on learning how to code

- It takes lots of practice and lots of errors
- Only dumb question is one you don't ask
- Google, Stack Exchange are your friends
- Try writing out in comments what you want to do in code
- Learn to recognize patterns in the questions/tasks I give you:
  - Copy and paste code I give
  - Change one thing
  - Fix the error
  - Adapt code from class to do a similar thing
- Learning to code is much less painful when you have a reason to do it
  - I'll try to use interesting data, but please let me know if there are questions or data you'd like us to explore

# Descriptive Statistics

---
## Measures of Central Tendency

Measures of central tendency describe what a typical value of some variable. In this course, we'll use three measures of what's typical:

- mean
- median
- mode

---
## Mean

One of the most frequent measures of central tendency we'll use in this course is a mean or average.

Suppose we have `\(n\)` observations of some variable `\(x\)`. We'll define the sample mean of `\(x\)` as `\(\bar{x}\)` ("x bar), and calculate it by adding up all the values of x

`$$\bar{x}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n x_i$$`



```r
mean(covid_us$new_cases_pc, na.rm=T)
```

```
[1] 33.20571
```

---
## Conditional Means

Last wee, when we calculated the the average number of new cases under each type of face mask policy, we were calculating a **conditional mean** the mean of some variable, conditional on some other variable taking a specific value.

Formally, you'll often see this written in terms of **Expected Values**: Something like

`$$E[Y|X=x]$$`

Or to make it more concrete:

`$$E[\text{New Cases} | \text{Policy = "Recommended"}]$$`

---
## Conditional Means


In R, we could calculate:


`$$E[\text{New Cases} | \text{Policy = "Recommended"}]$$`



```r
mean(covid_us$new_cases_pc[covid_us$face_masks == "No policy"], na.rm=T)
```

```
[1] 1.808998
```

Where the `[]` index operator selects only the observations of `covid_us$new_cases_pc` where `covid_us$face_masks` is equal to "No policy" 

---
## Calculating Multiple Conditional Means

By using `group_by()` with `summarise()` we can calculate multiple conditional means


```r
covid_us%&gt;%
  group_by(face_masks)%&gt;%
  summarise(
    new_cases_pc = mean(new_cases_pc, na.rm=T)
  )
```

```
# A tibble: 6 × 2
  face_masks             new_cases_pc
  &lt;fct&gt;                         &lt;dbl&gt;
1 No policy                      1.81
2 Recommended                    8.08
3 Some requirements             41.7 
4 Required shared places        30.0 
5 Required all times            32.0 
6 &lt;NA&gt;                          94.6 
```


---
### Median


The median is another measure of what's typical for variables that take numeric values

Imagine, we took our data new Covid-19 cases and arranged them in ascending order, from the smallest value to highest value

The median would be the value in the exact middle of that sequence, also known as the 50th percentile.

---
### Median

Formally, we can define that median as:


`$$M_x = X_i : \int_{-\infty}^{x_i} f_x(X)dx=\int_{x_i}^\infty f_x(X)dx=1/2$$`

Which might look like Greek to you, which is fine. Just think of it as the middle value.

In R:


```r
median(covid_us$new_cases_pc, na.rm=T)
```

```
[1] 14.10355
```



---
### Medians and Means

Note the median is much lower than the mean. 


```r
mean(covid_us$new_cases_pc, na.rm=T)
```

```
[1] 33.20571
```

```r
median(covid_us$new_cases_pc, na.rm=T)
```

```
[1] 14.10355
```

Which one is a better summary of what's typical?


---
If we were to look at a histogram of our data (more on that today), we see that the `new_cases_pc` has a "long tail" or is skewed to the right. Most of the values are close to 0, but there are few cases that are extreme outliers.

&lt;img src="02-slides_files/figure-html/hist-1.png" width="80%" height="400px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;



---
### Modes

Conceptually, a mode describes the most frequent outcome. 

Modes are useful for describing what's typical of "nominal" or categorical data like our measure of face mask policy. 

---
### Modes

To calculate the mode of our `face_masks` variable, wrap the output of `table()` with the `sort()` function


```r
sort(table(covid_us$face_masks))
```

```

    Required all times              No policy            Recommended 
                  1043                   2513                   2849 
Required shared places      Some requirements 
                 13844                  16296 
```

---
### Modes

For numeric data, modes correspond to the peak of a variable's density function (more on this later in the class). 

You can get a sense of the relationship between, means, median's and modes from this helpful figure from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_(statistics)):

&lt;img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Visualisation_mode_median_mean.svg/240px-Visualisation_mode_median_mean.svg.png" width="200" height="400px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


---
## Measures of Dispersion

Measures of dispersion describe how much the data "vary." Let's discuss the following ways we can summarize how our data vary:

- range
- percentile range
- variance
- standard deviation

---
### Range

The range of a variable is simply it's minimum and maximum value


```r
range(covid_us$new_cases_pc,na.rm = T)
```

```
[1] -188.6931 1531.8669
```

```r
min(covid_us$new_cases_pc,na.rm = T)
```

```
[1] -188.6931
```

```r
max(covid_us$new_cases_pc,na.rm = T)
```

```
[1] 1531.867
```

---
## What states on what dates observed these minimum and maximum values?

.left-column[

- FL looks like a clerical error in reporting

- RI looks like Omicron
]


.right-column[

```r
covid_us %&gt;%
  filter(
    new_cases_pc &lt; -188 |
    new_cases_pc &gt; 1500
  )%&gt;%
  select(state, date,new_cases_pc)
```

```
# A tibble: 2 × 3
# Groups:   state [2]
  state        date       new_cases_pc
  &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;date&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;
1 Florida      2021-06-04        -189.
2 Rhode Island 2022-01-04        1532.
```
]

---
### Percentiles Ranges

The `\(p\)`-th percentile is the value of the observation such that 100\*p percent of the data are to the left and 100-100\*p are two the right.

`$$p_x = X_i : \int_{-\infty}^{x_i} f_x(X)dx= p; \int_{x_i}^\infty f_x(X)dx=1-p$$`


The median is just the 50th percentile

---
### Percentiles Ranges

In R we calculate the `\(p\)`-th percentile using the `quantile()` setting the `probs` argument to the `\(p/100\)` percentile that we we want.



```r
quantile(covid_us$new_cases_pc, probs = c(.25,.75), na.rm=T)
```

```
      25%       75% 
 4.030745 36.697633 
```


The 25th and 75th percentile define the "Interquartile Range" where 50 percent of the observations lie within this range, and 50 percent lie outside the range.

---
### Variance

Variance describes how much observations of a given measure vary around that measure's mean.

The variance in a given sample is calculated by taking the average of the sum of squared deviations (i.e. differences) around a measure's mean.

`$$\sigma^2_x=\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\bar{x})^2$$`

- `\(x_i-\bar{x}\)` is the deviation of each observation from the overall mean
- `\((x_i-\bar{x})^2\)` squaring this ensures that we treat positive and negative deviations the same when calculating the overall variance
- `\(\sum_{i=1}\)` sums up all the differences
- `\(\frac{1}{n-1}\)` is like taking the average of these differences (we divide by `\(n-1\)` instead of `\(n\)` for [statistical reasons](https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/mks/M358KInstr/SampleSDPf.pdf) that we'll return two when we talk about estimation)

---
### Variance

We can use the `var()` function to calculate the variance of the `new_cases_pc` variable.


```r
var(covid_us$new_cases_pc,na.rm=T)
```

```
[1] 4328.978
```

```r
# Calculate by hand

sum(
  (covid_us$new_cases_pc - mean(covid_us$new_cases_pc,na.rm=T))^2, 
  na.rm=T
  )/(sum(!is.na(covid_us$new_cases_pc))-1)
```

```
[1] 4328.978
```


Variance will be important for thinking about uncertainty and inference (e.g. how might our estimate have been different)

---
### Standard Deviations


A standard deviation is simply the square root of variable's variance. 


`$$\sigma_x=\sqrt{\sigma^2_x}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\bar{x})^2}$$`

Standard deviations are easier to interpet because their units are the same as variable. 

Think of them as a measure of the typical amount of variation for variable.

Again, let's use the `sd()` function to calculate the standard deviation of the `new_cases_pc` variable


```r
sd(covid_us$new_cases_pc,na.rm=T)
```

```
[1] 65.79497
```

---
## Measures of Association

Measures of association describe how variables relate to each other.

- Covariance
- Correlation

---
### Covariance

Covariance describes how two variables "co-vary". 

When `\(x\)` is above its mean, `\(y\)` also tends to be above it's mean, these variables have a positive covariance. 

If when `\(x\)` tends to be high, `\(y\)` tends to be low, these variables have a negative variance

---
### Covariance

Formally, the sample covariance of two variables can written as follows:

`$$cov(x,y)=\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\bar{x})(y_i-\bar{y})$$`

The covariance between the percent of state's population that is fully vaccinated (`percent_vaccinated`) and `new_cases_pc` is:


```r
var(covid_us$new_cases_pc,covid_us$percent_vaccinated,na.rm = T)
```

```
[1] 263.7108
```


---
background-image:url("https://c.tenor.com/unFf-IWvWuEAAAAC/doesnt-look-like-anything-to-me-westworld.gif")
background-size:contain

---
### Correlation

Like variances, covariances don't really have intrinsic meaning, since x and y can be measured on very different scales.

The correlation between two variables takes their covariance and scales this by the standard deviation of each variable, creating a measure that can range from -1 (perfect negative correlation) to 1 perfect positive correlation.

---
### Correlation
Again, we can write this formally

`$$\rho_{x,y} = \frac{cov(x,y)}{\sigma_x,\sigma_y}$$`

---
### Correlation

We can calculate the correlation between vaccination rates and new cases using the `cor()` function

You'll need to set the argument `use="complete.obs`


```r
cor(covid_us$percent_vaccinated, covid_us$new_cases_pc, use = "complete.obs")
```

```
[1] 0.1427753
```

Hmm... That seems a little strange. What if we calculated the correlation between vaccination rates and new cases separately for each month in 2021

---
### Correlation


```r
covid_us %&gt;%
  filter(year &gt; 2020)%&gt;%
  ungroup() %&gt;%
  group_by(year,month)%&gt;%
  summarise(
    mn_per_vax = round(mean(percent_vaccinated, na.rm=T),2),
    cor = round(cor(new_cases_pc, percent_vaccinated, use = "complete.obs"),2)
  ) -&gt; monthly_vax_case_correlations
```

## Concept Check

Descriptive statistics tell us what's typical of our data:

- What's a typical value
  - mean, median mode
- What's a typical amount of variation
  - ranges, percentile ranges, variance, standard deviation
- How does one variable typically change as another variable changes
  - covariance and correlations

---
## Correlation does not equal causation


.pull-left[
- I think I'm contractually obliged to repeat this to you. 
- Next week, we'll provide a precise definition of causation
- For now consider the following:
  - Y is clearly related to x, but has a correlation of 0


```r
x &lt;- -10:10
y &lt;- abs(x)
cor(x,y)
```

```
[1] 0
```

##  Data Visualization 

Data visualization is an incredibly valuable tool that helps us to

- Explore data, uncovering new relationships, as well as potential problems
- Communicate our results clearly and precisely

Take a look at how the [BBC](https://medium.com/bbc-visual-and-data-journalism/how-the-bbc-visual-and-data-journalism-team-works-with-graphics-in-r-ed0b35693535) uses R to produce its graphics

Today, we will

- Produce basic figures in R that describe
- Introduce a `grammar of graphics`
- Learn how to apply this grammar with `ggplot`
