## Random Experiments, Sets Theory, and Counting Rules


---
## Random Experiments and Sample Spaces

- In probability theory, a **Random Experiment:** describes a repeatable process where the outcome is uncertain (non-deterministic)

- The **Sample Space** is the **set** of all possible outcomes of an experiment ($S$) 


**Examples**

- Flip a coin 

- Flip a coin 10 times and count the number of heads

- Number of wars in the 20th century

- Outcome of an election

---
## Sets

- In mathematics, a set is bounded collection of elements

- If `\(A\)` is the set of outcomes from a coin toss then `\(A=\{Heads,Tails\}\)`

---
## Elements

- An object within a set

- `1` is an element in set of outcomes from rolling a six-sided die 

---
## Events

- An Event is a collection of outcomes of an experiment

  - Could contain a single element, multiple elements, no elements, or all the elements.

- If the event `\(B\)` is rolling an odd number, then `\(B=\{1,3,5\}\)`

- The outcome `3` is an element of `\(B\)` ($3 \in B$)

- The outcome `4` is not an element of `\(B\)` ($4 \notin B$)


---
## How many elements in a set?

A set can be:

- **Countably Finite:** 
  
  - Roll a die, there six possible outcomes `\(\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}\)`


- **Countably Infinite:** 

  - Number of rolls until a six appears `\({1,2,3,\dots}\)`

--

- **Uncountably Infinite:** 

  - All the real numbers between 0 and 1 `\((0,1)\)`

## How many possible outfits could you have made me wear?

## How to count


The Fundamental Counting Principle says that if there `\(x\)` ways to do one thing and `\(z\)` ways to do another then, then are their are `\(x \times z\)` total ways of doing both tasks.

More generally, if there are 

- If there are `\(j\)` tasks or decision stages

- And `\(k\)` choices at each decision stage `\(j\)` such that `\(n_{j,k} = k\)`

- The total number of possible outcomes is the product of the number number of choices `\(k\)` and each stage, `\(j\)` `\(\prod_{i=1}^{j} n_k = n_{i,k}*n_{2,k}*\dots*n_{j,k}\)` 


---
## How many different outfits could you have made me wear?

- **Palette**: `\(\{\text{Fall, Winter, Spring, Summer}\}\)`
- **Jacket**: `\(\{\text{Tuxedo, Tweed,Blazer, Sportcoat, No coat}\}\)`
- **Top**: `\(\{\text{Dress Shirt, Polo, Tee Shirt, Sports Jersey}\}\)`
- **Pant**: `\(\{\text{Slacks, Khakis, Jeans, Shorts}\}\)`
- **Shoe**: `\(\{\text{Dress Shoe, Dress boot, Jordans, Dunks, Basketball, Crocs}\}\)`
- **Tie**: `\(\{\text{Repp, Pattern, Knit, Bow, No tie}\}\)`
- **Pattern**: `\(\{\text{Simple, Stripes, Checks, Graphic}\}\)`

- How many decision stages?

- How many choices at each stage?

- How many possible outfits?

---
## How many different suggested outfits could you have made me wear?

- How many decision stages? `\(j=7\)`

- How many choices at each stage? 

- **Palette**: $\{\text{Fall, Winter, Spring, Summer}\} = n_{jk} = 4 $ 
- **Jacket**: `\(\{\text{Tuxedo, Tweed,Blazer, Sportcoat, No coat}\} = n_{jk} = 5\)`
- **Top**: `\(\{\text{Dress Shirt, Polo, Tee Shirt, Sports Jersey}\} = n_{jk} = 4\)`
- **Pant**: `\(\{\text{Slacks, Khakis, Jeans, Shorts}\} = n_{jk} = 4\)`
- **Shoe**: `\(\{\text{Dress Shoe, Dress boot, Jordans, Dunks, Basketball, Crocs}\} = n_{jk} = 6\)`
- **Tie**: `\(\{\text{Repp, Pattern, Knit, Bowtie, No tie}\} = n_{jk} = 5\)`
- **Pattern**: `\(\{\text{Simple, Stripes, Checks, Graphic}\} = n_{jk} = 4\)`

- How many possible suggestions? `\(\prod_{i=1}^{j} n_{jk} = 4 \times 5 \times 4 \times 4 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 = 38,400 \text{ outfits}\)`

## And yet you chose this:

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I send students in my undergraduate research class a weekly survey to get a sense of what&amp;#39;s working and what&amp;#39;s not. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I also ask them silly questions just for fun. Last week, I asked them to help me with my fit. This was the result: &lt;a href="https://t.co/w1t8Cr04Ap"&gt;pic.twitter.com/w1t8Cr04Ap&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Paul Testa (@ProfPaulTesta) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ProfPaulTesta/status/1501291241404833795?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 8, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

## Counting with Regard to Order and Replacement

In general, when we think about the total number of outcomes, it matters whether 

- we are counting *with* or *without* replacement
- we can distinguish the order of observations




```r
counting_tab &lt;- tibble::tibble(
  ` ` = c("Yes", "No"),
  `Yes` = c("$n^k $", "$ \\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$"),
  `No` = c("$\\binom{n}{k}=\\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$","$\\binom{n+k-1}{k}=\\frac{(n+k-1)!}{(n-1)!k!}$")
)

knitr::kable(counting_tab)%&gt;%HTML%&gt;%browsable()
```

<table>
 <thead>
  <tr>
   <th style="text-align:left;">   </th>
   <th style="text-align:left;"> Yes </th>
   <th style="text-align:left;"> No </th>
  </tr>
 </thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Yes </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> $n^k $ </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> $\binom{n}{k}=\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$ </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> No </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> $ \frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$ </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> $\binom{n+k-1}{k}=\frac{(n+k-1)!}{(n-1)!k!}$ </td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## Operations on Sets

- Empty Set: `\(\o\)` a set with no elements
- Subset: 
    - `\(D=\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}\)`
    - `\(Primes=\{2,3,5\}\)`
    - `\(Primes \subset D \iff \forall X \in Primes, X \in D\)`
- Unions
    - `\(A \cup B = \{X:X \in A \lor X \in B \}\)`
    - Either `\(A\)`, `\(B\)` or both `\(A and B\)` occur
- Intersections
    - `\(A \cap B = \{X:X \in A \land X \in B \}\)`
    - Both `\(A\)` and `\(B\)` occur
- Complements
    - `\(A^\complement = \{X:X\notin A\}\)`
    - `\(A^\complement\)` means `\(A\)` does not occur
    - `\(\o^\complement=S\)` and `\(S^\complement=\o\)`

## Properties of Sets

### Commutative
`\(A \cup B = B \cup A\)`
`\(A \cap B = B \cap A\)`


### Associative
`\(A\cap (B \cap C) = (A \cap B)\cap C\)`
`\(A\cup (B \cup C) = (A \cup B)\cup C\)`

---
## Properties of Sets

### Distributive
`\(A\cap (B \cup C)=(A\cap B)\cup (A \cap C)\)`
`\(A\cup (B \cap C)=(A\cup B)\cap (A \cup C)\)`

### de Morgan's Law
- `\((A \cup B)^\complement = A^\complement \cap B^\complement\)`
- `\((A \cap B)^\complement = A^\complement \cup B^\complement\)`


---
## Mutually Exclusive (Pairwise Disjoint)

- `\(A_i\cap A_j = \o \forall i \neq j\)`
- `\(\bigcup_{i=1}^k A_i = S \rightarrow A_1 \dots A_k\)` is a **partition**  of the sample space
