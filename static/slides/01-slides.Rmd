## YAML + Markdown + R -> Render -> Output

---
# R Markdown Workflow

1. Open a .Rmd
2. Choose your output
3. Update the YAML
3. Write text in Markdown
4. Embed your code in code chunks
5. Render your document using `knitr` to knit your code and markdown into output

# Basic Programming in R

---
## The Basics of R

- R is an interpreter (>)

- Everything that exists is an object

- Everything that happens is a result of a function

- Packages make R great

---
## R is an interpreter (>)

--

Enter commands line-by-line in the console

--

* The `>` means R is a ready for a command

--

* The `+` means your last command isn't complete

--

  - If you get stuck with a `+` use your escape key!

--

* Send commands from your R script (.Rmd or .R file) to the console:

  - `cntrl + Enter` (PC) |  `cmd + Return` (Mac) -> run current line
  - `cntrl + shift + Enter` (PC) |  `cmd + shift  + Return` (Mac) -> run all code in current chunk
  


---
# Everything that exists in R is an object

- The number 5 is an object in R
```{r}
5
```

- We can assign the object 5, the name x, using the assignment operator `<-`+

```{r}
x <- 5 # Read this as "x gets 5"
```

- Now if we tell R to show us x, we'll get

```{r}
x
print(x)
```

---
## Data come in different types

.pull-left[
* Numeric (2 subtypes)
    - Integers (`1, 50`)
    - Double (`1.5, 50.25`, `?double`)
* Character (`"hello"`)
* Factor (`grade = "A" | grade = "B"`)
* Logical (`TRUE | FALSE`)

```{r}
# Create some data
y <- 6L # Integer
only_two_types_of_people <- TRUE # Logical
me <- "Paul"
grades = factor(c("A","B","C"))
```

]

.pull-right[
```{r}


# What type are they
class(x)
class(y)
class(only_two_types_of_people)
class(me)
class(grades)
```
]

---
## Data come in different "shapes" and "sizes"

Name | "Size" | Type of Data  | R code
-----|-------------|------|-----
scalar | 1 | numeric, character, factor, logical |  `x <- 5` 
vector | N elements: `length(x)` |all the same  |` v <- c(1, 2, T, "false")`
matrix | N rows by columns K: `dim(x)` | all the same |` m <- matrix(y,2,2)`
array |  N row by K column by J dimensions: `dim(x)` |all the same  | `a <- array(m,c(2,2,3))`
data frames |  N row by K column matrix | can be different | `d <-data.frame(x=x, y=y)`
tibbles |  N row by K column matrix | can be different | `d <-tibble(x=x, y=y)`
lists |  can vary | can be different | `l <-list(x,y,m,a,d)`

--
- We will mostly work with `data.frames` and `tibbles` (a data.frame with added bells and whistles)

## Everything that happens in R is the result of a function

- You've already seen and used some R functions
  - the `<-` is the assignement operator that assigns 
  - `c()` is the combine function that combines elements together
  - `install.packages()` installs packages
  - `library()` loads packages you've installed so you can use functions and data that are part of that package
- Three sources of functions:
  - base R `<-; mean(x); library("package_name")`
  - packages `remotes::intall_github("user/repository")`
  - You `my_function <- function(x){x^2}`
  
---
## Functions are like recipes

They have

.pull-left[
- names

- ingredients (inputs)

- steps that tell you what to do with the ingredients (statements/code)

- tasty results from applying those steps to given ingredients (outputs)
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
can_x_kick_it <- function(x){
  # Determine if x can kick it
  # If x in A Tribe Called Quest
  if(x %in% c("Q-Tip","Phife Dawg",
              "Ali Shaheed Muhammad", 
              "Jarobi White")){
    return("Yes you can")
  }else{
    return("Before this, did you really know what live was?")
  }

}
can_x_kick_it("Q-Tip")
can_x_kick_it("Paul")
```

# Excerise 2. Explore objects and functions in base `R`

---
## R is a Calculator 

In the .Rmd file you created for this class

1. Delete the template  (everything below the YAML Header)
2. Create a new code chunk (cmd/cntrl + shift + I)
3. Copy the following into your code chunk and interpret the results:

```{r, eval = F}
# Create objects
x <- 5
y <- T
z <- 1:5

# Look at objects
x
y
z

# Manipulate objects
x*x
y+x
x^z

```


--- 
## Different Types of Objects in R

.pull-left[
- Run the following code
- Print the objects in R's console
]

.pull-right[
```{r}

v <- c(1, 2, T, "false") # Vector
m <- matrix(y, nrow = 2, ncol = 2) # Matrix
a <- array(m, c(2, 2, 3)) # Array
d <- data.frame(x = x, y = y) # Dataframe
t <- tibble(x = x, y = y) # Tibble
l <- list(x, y, m, a, d, t) # List

```

## Coding in R

- We use functions to manipulate objects in R
- Class/type/mode of objects matters
- Use \# to comment your code
- Give objects meaningful names
- Use consistent naming conventions:
  - snake_case
  - CamelCase
  - SpONgeBObCaSE (don't do this)



# Setting up your work space

## Getting set up to work in R

1. Set your working directory to the source file location
  - Session > Set working Directory > Source File Location
  - Make sure your document is saved in folder with the other files (data) you'll need

---
## Getting set up to work in R

1.  Set your working directory to the source file location

--

2. Load (and, if needed, install) R packages that you will be using
  - Install packages once with `install.packages("package_name")`
  - Load packages to use during your work session with `library("package_name")`
  - Periodically check for updates in package panel on the lower right
  
---
## Getting set up to work in R

1. Set your working directory to the source file location

2. Load (and, if needed, install) R packages that you will be using

-- 

3. Change any global options
  - I'll typically do this for you
  - Useful for controlling how code or figures are displayed

--

4. Load the data you're going to be using 
    
---

# Loading data into R

---
## Loading data into R

There are three ways to load data.

- Load a pre-existing dataset
  - `data("dataset")` will load the dataset named "dataset"
  - `data()` will list all datasets
- Load a .Rdata/.rda file using `load("dataset.rda")`
- Read data of a different format (.csv, .dta, .spss) into R using specific functions
  - We will use functions from the `haven` and `readr` packages to read data from the web and stored locally on your computer
  
```{r,eval=F}
# Reading data from a webiste
df_web <- readr::read_csv("https://pols1600.paultesta.org/files/data.rda")
# Reading data from your computer
df_local <- haven::read_dta("~/Desktop/pols1600/lab/data.rda")
```

## Installing the `tidyverse` and `COVID19` packages

Let's install the `tidyverse` and `COVID19`.

Copy and paste the following into your console

```{r}
install.packages(c("tidyverse","COVID19"))
```
