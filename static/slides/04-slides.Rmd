  - K-means clustering
  - Gini Coefficients
  - `swirl()`
 
- If there are specific sections of QSS that are particularly confusing, let me know!

---
##  Mapping Concepts to Code

- Takes time and practice

- Don't be afraid to FAAFO

- Don't worry about memorizing everything. 

- Statistical programming is necessary to actually **do** empirical research

- Learning to code will help us understand statistical concepts.

- Learning to think programmatically and algorithmically will help us tackle complex problems

## Descriptive statistics


---
## Descriptive statistics

- Descriptive statistics help us describe what's typical of our data

--
- What's a typical value in our data
  - [Mean](https://pols1600.paultesta.org/labs/01-lab-comments.html#81_Measures_of_Central_Tendency)
  - [Median](https://pols1600.paultesta.org/labs/01-lab-comments.html#81_Measures_of_Central_Tendency)
  - [Mode](https://pols1600.paultesta.org/labs/01-lab-comments.html#81_Measures_of_Central_Tendency)

--
- How much do our data vary?
  - [Variance](https://pols1600.paultesta.org/labs/01-lab-comments.html#82_Measures_of_Dispersion)
  - [Standard deviation](https://pols1600.paultesta.org/labs/01-lab-comments.html#82_Measures_of_Dispersion)

--
- As one variable changes how does another change?
  - [Covariance](https://pols1600.paultesta.org/labs/01-lab-comments.html#83_Measures_of_Association)
  - [Correlation](https://pols1600.paultesta.org/labs/01-lab-comments.html#83_Measures_of_Association)

---
## Mean: Conceptual Understanding

A mean is:
  
- A common and important measure of central tendency (what's typical)

- It's the arithmetic average you learned in schooll

- We can think of it as the balancing point of a distribution

- A conditional mean is the average of one variable $X$, when some other variable, $Z$ takes a value $z$

  - Think about the average height in our class (unconditional mean) vs the average height among men and women (conditional means)


---
## Mean as a balancing point


![](https://mathbitsnotebook.com/Algebra1/StatisticsData/balancepoint1.jpg)

[Source](https://mathbitsnotebook.com/Algebra1/StatisticsData/STCenter.html)

---
## Mean: Practical

There are lots of ways to calculate means in `R`

- The simplest is to use the `mean()` function
  
  - If our data have missing values, we need to to tell `R` to remove them 
  
```{r meanex,eval=F}
mean(df$x, na.rm=T)
```

---
## Conditional Means: Practical

  
  - To calculate a conditional mean we could us a logical index `[df$z == 1]` 

```{r conmean,eval=F}
mean(df$x[df$z == 1], na.rm=T)
```
  
- If we wanted to a calculate a lot of conditional means we could use the `mean()` in combination with `group_by()` and `summarise()`

```{r grpmean, eval=F}
df %>% 
  group_by(z)%>%
  summarise(
    x = mean(x, na.rm=T)
  )
```


---
## Mean: Definitional

Formally, we can define the arithmetic mean of $x$ as $\bar{x}$:

$$
\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n}\left (\sum_{i=1}^n{x_i}\right ) = \frac{x_1+x_2+\cdots +x_n}{n}
$$

In words, this formula says, to calculate the average of x, we sum up all the values of $x_i$ from observation $i=1$ to $i=n$ and then divide by the total number of observations $n$


---
## Mean: Definitional

- In this class, I don't put a lot of weight on memorizing definitions (that's what Google's for).

- But being comfortable with "the math" is important and useful

- Definitional knowledge is a prerequisite for understanding more theoretical claims.

---
## Mean: Theoretical

Suppose I asked you to show that the sum of deviations from a mean equals 0?

$$
\text{Claim:} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i -\bar{x}) = 0
$$

---
## Mean: Theoretical

Knowing the definition of an arithmetic mean, we could write: 


$$\begin{aligned}
\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i -\bar{x}) &= \sum_{i=1}^n x_i - \sum_{i=1}^n\bar{x} & \text{Distribute Summation}\\
              &= \sum_{i=1}^n x_i - n\bar{x} & \text{Summing a constant, } \bar{x}\\
              &= \sum_{i=1}^n x_i - n\times \left ( \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n{x_i}\right ) & \text{Definition of } \bar{x}\\
              &= \sum_{i=1}^n x_i - \sum_{i=1}^n{x_i} & n \times \frac{1}{n}=1\\
              &= 0             
\end{aligned}$$


---
## Mean: Theoretical

Why do we care?

- Showing the deviations sum to 0 is another way of saying the mean is a "balancing point." 

- This turns out to be a useful property of means that will reappear throughout the course

- If I asked you to make a prediction, $\hat{x}$ of a random person's height in this class, the mean would have the lowest "mean squared error" (MSE $=\frac{1}{n}\sum (x_i - \hat{x_i})^2)$ 



---
## Mean: Theoretical

Occasionally, you'll read or here me say  say things like:

> The sample mean is an unbiased estimator of the population mean

In a statistics class, we would take time to prove this.


---
## The sample mean is an unbiased estimator of the population mean

Claim:

Let $x_1, x_2, \dots x_n$ from a random sample from a population with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$

Then:

$$
\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n}\left (\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\right )
$$

is an unbiased estimator of $\mu$

$$
E[\bar{x}] = \mu
$$

---
## The sample mean is an unbiased estimator of the population mean


Proof:

$$\begin{aligned}
E\left [\bar{x} \right] &= E\left [\frac{1}{n}\left (\sum_{i=1}^n x_i \right) \right] & \text{Definition of } \bar{x} \\
&= \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^nE\left [ x_i \right]  & \text{Linearity of Expectations} \\
&= \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \mu  & E[x_i] = \mu \\
&= \frac{n}{n}  \mu  & \sum_{i=1}^n \mu = n\mu \\
&= \mu  & \blacksquare \\
\end{aligned}$$


---
## Levels of understanding

In this course, we tend to emphasize the 

- **Conceptual**

- **Practical**

Over

- Definitional

- Theoretical


In an intro statistics class, the ordering might be reversed.

Trade offs:

- Pro: We actually get to *work with data* and *do empirical research* much sooner
- Cons: We substitute intuitive understandings for more rigorous proofs

## Data visualization


---
## Data visualization as a tool for descriptive inference

A statistical graphic is a mapping of `data` variables to `aes` thetic attributes of `geom` etric objects.

At a minimum, a graphic contains three core components:

- `data:` the dataset containing the variables of interest.
- `aes`: aesthetic attributes of the geometric object. For example, x/y position, color, shape, and size. Aesthetic attributes are mapped to variables in the dataset.
- `geom:` the geometric object in question. This refers to the type of object we can observe in a plot For example: points, lines, and bars.

## Causal inference

## Causal inference is about counterfactual comparisons

- Causal inference is about counterfactual comparisons
  
  - What would have happened if some aspect of the world either had or had not been present

---
## Causal inference is about counterfactual comparisons

Two ways to represent causal claims

- DAGs helped illustrate types of bias
  - **Confounder bias:** Failing to control for a common cause (aka Selection Bias, Omitted Variable Bias)
  - **Collider bias:** Controlling for a common consequence 

- Potential Outcomes Notation helped illustrate the **Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference**

---
## Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference

- For an individual, we only observe one of potential many potential outcomes.
  
  - Did taking an aspirin make your headache go away?
  
  - Need to compare you with aspirin and without, but only see one version of the world.

- Individual Causal Effects are **unidentified**

---
## Causal Identification


- Causal Identification: What do we need to assume for your causal claim to be credible

- Randomization offers a solution to the fundamental problem by ensuring that treatment is independent of potential outcomes $(Y(1), Y(0))$, observed $(X)$, and unobserved covariates $(U)$.

$$
Y(1), Y(0),X,U, \perp D
$$

---
## Randomization creates credible counterfactual comparisons

If treatment has been randomly assigned, then:

- The only thing that differs between treatment and control is that one group got the treatment, and another did not.
- We can estimate the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) using the difference of sample means


$$\begin{aligned}
E \left[ \frac{\sum_1^m Y_i}{m}-\frac{\sum_{m+1}^N Y_i}{N-m}\right]&=\overbrace{E \left[ \frac{\sum_1^m Y_i}{m}\right]}^{\substack{\text{Average outcome}\\
\text{among treated}\\ \text{units}}}
-\overbrace{E \left[\frac{\sum_{m+1}^N Y_i}{N-m}\right]}^{\substack{\text{Average outcome}\\
\text{among control}\\ \text{units}}}\\
&= E [Y_i(1)|D_i=1] -E[Y_i(0)|D_i=0]
\end{aligned}$$

## What's the counterfactual?

> Broadly speaking, I don't like computers. I don't like bending over the small desks, staring at a screen, etc. The class is fine: it's something I have to do, all things worth doing are difficult, and I'm learning to think in new ways. That said, I tend to doubt that computer programing is conducive to human flourishing. Would the world be a better place if everyone learned how to code? I tend to think no. Would the world be a better place if everyone read Shakespeare? Probably. This isn't really a practical concern, but rather a question about, y'know, what we're doing here. 

> More concretely, I found the lab hard to complete, but I'll look over the notes and review. Part of me thinks I'd learn better if I started the labs before class. I'd ask better questions, be less confused, etc. 

> In sum: the class is fine. It's good to learn to think in new ways and good to be challenged, even if I have some broader questions about coding as a human activity."

- How should we define/measure human flourishing?

--

- What are some counterfactuals  we might make?
  - Everyone learns to code:
  - You learning to code:
  - Learning to code vs reading Shakespeare

--

- Why might these comparisons be misleading?
  - CS concentrators to POLS concentrators
  - POLS 1600 takers to POLS 0500

- How could we assess the "effects" of POLS 1600?

# Casual Inference in Experimental and Observational Designs

---
## Experimental and Observational Designs

- **Experimental designs** are studies in which a causal variable of interest, the *treatement*, is manipulated by the researcher to examine its causal effects on some *outcome* of interest

  - **Randomized Controlled Trial** (RCTs) each unit is **randomly** assigned to a treatment(s) or control group

- **Observational designs** are studies in which a causal variable of interest is assigned by someone other than the researcher (nature, governments, people)

---
## Causal Identification

- **Casual Identification** refers to "the assumptions needed for statistical estimates to be given a causal interpretation" [Keele (2015)](http://lukekeele.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/causal.pdf)

- **What's  Your Casual Identification Strategy:** What are the assumptions that make your research design credible?

- Identification > Estimation

---
## Causal Identification with Experimental Designs

Causal identification for an experiment, requires relatively few assumptions:

- **Independence** (Satisfied by Randomization)
  - $Y(1), Y(0),X,U, \perp D$
- **SUTVA** Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (Depends on features of the design)
  - No interference between units $Y_i(d_1, d_2, \dots, d_N) = Y_i(d_i)$
  - No hidden values of the treatment/Variation in the treatment 



---
## Internal vs External Validity



- **Internal validity** the extent to which causal assumptions are satisfied in a study

- **External validity** the extent to which conclusions can be generalized beyond a particular study

---
## Internal vs External Validity

Experimental designs are said to have high **internal** validity, but may lack **external** validity

  - [The college sophomore problem](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0022-3514.51.3.515)
  
  - [The weirdest people in the world](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/weirdest-people-in-the-world/BF84F7517D56AFF7B7EB58411A554C17)

  - **The Hawthorne Effect** refers to the phenomenon where study subjects behave differently because they know they are being observed by researchers. (QSS Ch 2 p. 52)

---
## Causal Identification in Observational Designs

- In an *observational study* the researcher does not control the treatment assignment

- No guarantee that treatment (D=1) and control groups (D=0) are comparable (That is that we're comparing like with like)

- Instead, we have justify our claims by theory and assumption rather than direct manipulation through random assignment.

---
## Conditional Independence (ignorability)

If treatment is not randomly assigned then in general:

$$
Y_i(1),Y_i(0) \text{ is not} \perp D_i
$$


However, in some situations, it may be plausible to claim that *conditional* on some variable(s) $X$, the distribution of potential outcomes $Y$ is the same (independent) across levels of treatment $D$ (**conditional ignorability**)


$$
Y_i(1),Y_i(0) \perp D_i |X_i
$$

- Conditional on a some covariate(s) $X_i$ our treatment is **as-if randomized**

---
## As-if randomized

![](https://media.makeameme.org/created/dx-59c7bd.jpg)


---
## Causal Identification in Observational Designs

- The claim that treatment is as-if randomized requires further justification in the theory and design of your study

$$
Y_i(1),Y_i(0) \perp D_i |X_i
$$

- While we can't "prove" this assumption, we typically can test some observable implications of this claim,
  
  - For example, in [lab 03](https://pols1600.paultesta.org/labs/03-lab-comments.html#7_Examine_the_difference_in_covariates_between_those_assigned_to_each_treatment_condition_in_the_study) we tested for **covariate balance** by comparing the average values of pre-treatment covariates from the voter file.


---
## The Experimental Ideal

> ‚ÄúThe planner of an observational study should always ask himself: How would the study be conducted if it were possible to do it by controlled experimentation‚Äù (Cochran 1965)

- What would you have to randomly assign to answer your question as posed?

- Is it feasible to imagine changing just the treatment and nothing else? 

  - If yes, maybe we should do an experiment

  - If not, maybe we should rethink our question and ask what about the design of observational study allows us to make the credible comparisons that an experiment would generate?
  
---
## Observational Designs

Observational designs all involve covariate adjustment

We will discuss three approaches to covariate adjustment

- Subclassification
- Matching
- Regression

Then we will consider three types of observational desings that can produce credible causal claims:

- Difference in Difference
- Regression Discontinuities
- Instrumental Variables

## Covariate Adjustment

---
##  Covariate Adjustment

Covariate adjustment refers a broad class of procedures that try to make a comparison more credible or meaningful by adjusting for some other potentially confounding factor.

---
##  Covariate Adjustment

When you hear people talk about

- Controlling for age
- Conditional on income
- Holding age and income constant
- Ceteris paribus (All else equal)

They are typically talking about some sort of covariate adjustment.

---
##  Three approaches to for covariate adjustment

- Subclassification

- Matching 

- Regression 





---
##  Causal Identification through Subclassification

Motivation: Treatment, $D$ is not randomly assigned

$$
Y_i(1),Y_i(0) \text{ is not} \perp D_i
$$

Identifying assumptions

$$\begin{aligned}
Y_i(1),Y_i(0) \perp D_i |X_i && \text{Selection on Observables}\\
0 < Pr(D_i = 1|X_i) < 1  && \text{Common Support}
\end{aligned}$$

---
##  Causal Identification through Subclassification

If these assumptions hold, we can estimate the average treatment effect:

$$\begin{aligned}
ATE = E[Y_i(1)- Y_i(0)|X_i] &= E[Y_i(1)- Y_i(0)|X_i, D_i=1]\\
& = E[Y_i |X_i, D_i=1] - E[Y_i |X_i, D_i=0]
\end{aligned}$$

The average treatment effect is identified by the observed difference of means between treatment and control conditional on the values of $X$

---
##  Causal Identification through Subclassification

- Economists call $Y_i(1),Y_i(0) \perp D_i |X_i$ an assumption of **Selection on Observables**
  
  - Controlling for what we can observe $X$, $D$ is conditionally independent of Potential Outcomes
  
  - Violated if there were some other factor, $U$ that influenced both $D$ and $Y$

- $0 < Pr(D = 1|X) < 1$ is called an assumption of **Common Support**
  
  - There is a non-zero probability of receiving the treatment for all values of X
  
  - Violated if only one subgroup had access to the treatment (Vaccine by age group comparisons)

---
##  Example of Subclassification

- We used subclassification when we compared the unconditional rates of new Covid-19 cases by face mask policy to the conditional rates new cases by policy regime in each month of our data.
  - Overall rates are misleading. 
  - Lots of things differ between January 2020 and January 2022
  - Subclassification by month provides a "fairer" comparison
  - But is it "causal"

--
- Even controlling for "month" there are other omitted variables:
  - Other policies in place?
  - Socio-economic differences between states
  - Others?

--
- Trying to subclassify (stratify) comparisons on more than one or two variables gets hard
  - **The Curse of Dimensionality**

---
## The Curse of Dimensionality

- As we try to control for more factors, the number of observations per dimension declines rapidly
  - Men vs Women
  - Men, ages 20-30 vs Men ages 30-40
  - Men, ages 20-30 with college degrees and blue eyes vs Men  ages 20-30 with college degrees and green eyes

- Subclassification with more than a few variables, will often produce a lack of common support: 
  - Not enough observations to make credible counterfactual comparisons

---
## Matching

- Matching refers to a broad set of procedures that essentially try to generalize subclassification to 
  - address to **curse of dimensionality**
  - achieve balance on a range of observable covariates between **treated** and **control** groups

- Many different types of matching procedures:

  - **Exact matching:** Find exact matches between treatment and control observations for all covariates $X$
  - **Coarsened exact matching:** Find approximate matches within ranges of values for $X$
  - **Distance-metric matching:** Calculate a distance metric between observations based on their values of $X$, and match treated and control to minimize that distance
  - **Propensity score matching:** Calculate the propsenity to receive treatment using $X$ to predict $D$ and treated and control based on their *propensity scores*

---

```{r matching, echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics("https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/355318/images/Propensity-Score-Graphic.jpg")
```
[Source](https://www.summitllc.us/propensity-score-matching)

---
## Causal Identification with Matching

Matching again requires an assumption of **selection on observables**

$$\begin{aligned}
Y_i(1),Y_i(0) \perp D_i |X_i && \text{Selection on Observables}\\
0 < Pr(D_i = 1|X_i) < 1  && \text{Common Support}
\end{aligned}$$


Matching procedures like propensity score matching, allow us to match treated and control observations based on a *propensity score*, a predicted value of receiving the treatment, $D$ based on observed variables, $X$.

$$
p(X_i) = Pr(D=1|X_i) = \pi_i
$$

Allowing us to estimate an ATE conditional on $\pi_i$

$$\begin{aligned}
ATE &= E[Y_i(1)- Y_i(0)|p(X_i) = \pi_i] \\
&= E[Y_i(1)- Y_i(0)|p(X_i) = \pi_i, D_i=1]\\
& = E[Y_i |p(X_i) = \pi_i, D_i=1] - E[Y_i |p(X_i) = \pi_i, D_i=0]
\end{aligned}$$


---
## What to Know about Matching

- The mechanics of matching are beyond the scope of this course

- Just think of it as a generalization of subclassification when we want to condition on multiple variables

- "Solves" the curse of dimensionality, creating Treatment-Control comparisons between groups that are similar on **observed covariates**

- But **no guarantee** that matching produces balance on **unobserved covariates**.





---
## Regression

- We will spend the next two weeks talking in detail about regression, in general and linear regression in particular.

- Today we'll introduce some basic notation and simple examples

- Conceptually, think of regression as 
  - a tool to make predictions
  - by fitting lines to data

- Theoretically, we will build towards an understanding of linear regression as a "linear estimate of the conditional expectation function $(CEF = E[Y|X])$

---
## Regression

Broadly regression is a statistical procedural to help us model relationships that consists of:

- $Y$ an **outcome variable** or thing we're trying to explain
  - AKA: The Dependent Variable, The Response Variable, The Lefthand side of the model

- $X$ a set of **predictor variables** or things we think explain variation in our outcome
  - AKA: The independent variable, covariates, the right hand side of the model.

- $\beta$ a set of **unknown paramters** that describe the relationship between our outcome $Y$ and our predictors $X$

- $\epsilon$ the **error term** representing variation in $Y$ not explained by our model.

---
## Linear Regression

Next week, we will start to consider simple (bivariate) linear regressions of the form:

$$
y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \epsilon
$$

- We call this a bivariate regression, because there are only two variables.

- We call this a linear regression, because $y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i$ is the equation for a line, where:
  - $\beta_0$ corresponds to the $y$ intercept, or the model's prediction when $x = 0$.
  - $\beta_1$ corresponds to the slope, or how $y$ is predicted to change as $x$ changes.

---
## Linear Regression 
  
- If you find this notation confusing, try plugging in substantive concepts for what $y$ and $x$ represent
- Say we wanted to know how attitudes to transgender people varied with age in the baseline survey from Lab 03.

The generic linear model

$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \epsilon$$

Reflects:

$$\text{Transgender Feeling Thermometer}_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1\text{Age}_i + \epsilon_i$$

---
## Estimating a Linear Regression

- We estimate linear regressions in `R` using the `lm()` function.
- `lm()` requires two arguments:
  - a formula of the general form `y ~ x` read as "Y modeled by X" or below "Transgender Feeling Thermometer's modeled by Age
  - a `data` telling R 
  

```{r lmdata}
load(url("https://pols1600.paultesta.org/files/data/03_lab.rda"))
```

```{r m1}
m1 <- lm(therm_trans_t0 ~ vf_age, data = df)
m1
```

---
```{r figlm1code, echo = F}

```


---
## Multiple Regression

In two weeks, we will generalize this to include multiple predictors

$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{1i} + \beta_2  x_{2i} + \epsilon$$

- $\beta_0$ in this model still corresponds to the y intercept the model's prediction when everything else is 0 
- $\beta_1$ now describes the relationship between $x$


$$\text{FT}_{Trans} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Age}_{1i} + \beta_2  \text{Party ID}_{2i} + \epsilon$$

---
## Multiple Regression with Matrix Notation

With more than two predictors, we will write equations using Matrix notation

$$y_i = X\beta + \epsilon$$

.pull-left[
Where X is a matrix of variables:

$$X=
\begin{bmatrix}
	 1  & X_{1,1}&\dots & X_{1,k}\\
 1  & X_{2,1}&\dots & X_{2,k}\\
 \vdots&\vdots&  & \vdots \\
 1  & X_{n,1}&\dots & X_{n,k}\\
\end{bmatrix}$$
]
.pull-right[
And $\beta$ is a vector of coefficients

$$\beta=
\begin{bmatrix}
\beta_0\\
\beta_1\\
\vdots \\
\beta_k\\
\end{bmatrix}$$
]

---
## Causal Identification with Regression

Like subclassification and matching, causal identification with Linear Regression requires us to believe the assumption of **Selection on Observables**

$$
Y_i(1),Y_i(0) \perp D_i |X_i
$$

And additionally asks us to make assumptions about the "functional form": 

$$
Y = \beta_0 + \tau D + X\beta + \epsilon
$$


---
## Causal Identification with Regression

- To interpret a linear regression's estimate of $\tau$ as the causal effect of $D$ on $Y$, we need to believe we've got the *right model*
  
  - The only factors that predict both $Y$ and $D$ are those factors $X$ which we control for in our model.
  
  - The relationship between $Y$ and these predictors is *linear*

--

- We almost never have the right model.
  - Do we think age is the only factor that influences attitudes toward Trangendered folk? Probably not. 

--

- Regression is still a robust and useful tool
  - Why do we see negative relationship between age and transgender attitudes?

--

- But for causal inference, there's nothing inherent about estimating a regression, or controlling for a lot of variables that makes for particularly credible causal claims.

# Three Designs for Causal Inference in Observational Studies


---
## Credible Cauasal Inference in Observational Studies

Subclassification, matching, and regression all require an assumption of selection on observables:

$$
Y_i(1),Y_i(0) \perp D_i |X_i
$$

But how do we know if we've got the right model or we've controlled for the right variables?

--

Typically, we don't

---
## Credible Cauasal Inference in Observational Studies

Instead, social scientists  look for situations where the credibility of

$$
Y_i(1),Y_i(0) \perp D_i |X_i
$$

depends less on how much data you have and much more on how your data were generated.

## London in the Time of Cholera

---
## Motivating Example: What causes Cholera?

- In the 1800s, cholera was thought to be transmitted through the air.

- John Snow (the physician, not the snack), to explore the origins eventunally concluding that cholera was transmitted through living organisms in water.

- Leveraged a **natural experiment** in which one water company in London moved its pipes further upstream (reducing contamination for Lambeth), while other companies kept their pumps serving Southwark and Vauxhall in the same location. 

---
## Notation

Let's adopt a little notation to help us think about the logic of Snow's design:

- $D$: treatment indicator, 1 for treated neighborhoods (Lambeth), 0 for control neighborhoods (Southwark and Vauxhall)

- $T$: period indicator, 1 if post treatment (1854), 0 if pre-treatment (1849).

- $Y_{di}(t)$ the potential outcome of unit $i$ 

  - $Y_{1i}(t)$ the potential outcome of unit $i$ when treated between the two periods 

  - $Y_{0i}(t)$ the potential outcome of unit $i$ when control between the two periods 

---
## Causal Effects

The individual causal effect for unit i at time t is:

$$\tau_{it} = Y_{1i}(t) ‚àí Y_{0i}(t)$$

What we observe is 

$$Y_i(t) = Y_{0i}(t)\cdot(1 ‚àí D_i(t)) + Y_{1i}(t)\cdot D_i(t)$$

$D$ only equals 1, when $T$ equals 1, so we never observe $Y_0i(1)$ for the treated units. 

In words, we don't know what Lambeth's outcome would have been in the second period, had they not been treated.

---
## Average Treatment on Treated

Our goal is to estimate the average effect of treatment on treated (ATT):


$$\tau_{ATT} = E[Y_{1i}(1) -  Y_{0i}(1)|D=1]$$

That is, what would have happened in Lambeth, had their water company not moved their pipes

---
## Average Treatment on Treated

Our goal is to estimate the average effect of treatment on treated (ATT):

We we can observe is:

|               | Post-Period (T=1)  | Pre-Period (T=0)  |
|---------------|--------------------|-------------------|
| Treated $D_{i}=1$  | $E[Y_{1i}(1)\vert D_i = 1]$  | $E[Y_{0i}(0)\vert D_i = 1]$ |
| Control $D_i=0$  | $E[Y_{0i}(1)\vert D_i = 0]$  | $E[Y_{0i}(0)\vert D_i = 0]$ |

## Data

Because potential outcomes notation is abstract, let's consider a modified description of the Snow's cholera death data from [Scott Cunningham](https://mixtape.scunning.com/difference-in-differences.html):

```{r choleradat,echo=F}
snow <- tibble(Company = c("Lambeth (D=1)", "Southwark and Vauxhall (D=0"),
               `1854 (T=1)` = c(19,147),
               `1849 (T=0)` = c(85,135)
               )

knitr::kable(snow)

```

---
## How can we estimate the effect of moving pumps upstream?

Recall, our goal is to estimate the effect of the the treatment on the treated:

$$\tau_{ATT} = E[Y_{1i}(1) -  Y_{0i}(1)|D=1]$$

Let's conisder some strategies Snow could take to estimate this quantity:

---
## Before vs after comparisons:

- Snow could have compared Labmeth in 1854 $(E[Y_i(1)|D_i = 1] = 19)$ to Lambeth in 1849 $(E[Y_i(0)|D_i = 1]=85)$, and claimed that moving the pumps upstream led to 66 fewer cholera deaths. 

- This comparison assumes Lambeth's pre-treatment outcomes in 1849 are a good proxy for what its outcomes would have been in 1954 if the pumps hadn't moved ($E[Y_{0i}(1)|D_i = 1]$).

- A skeptic might argue that Lambeth in 1849 $\neq$ Lambeth in 1854


---
## Treatment-Control comparisons in the Post Period.

- Snow could have compared outcomes between Lambeth and S&V in 1954  ($E[Yi(1)|Di = 1] ‚àí E[Yi(1)|Di = 0]$), concluding that the change in pump locations led to 128 fewer deaths.

- Here the assumption is that the outcomes in S&V and in 1854 provide a good proxy for what would have happened in Lambeth in 1954 had the pumps not been moved ($E[Y_{0i}(1)|D_i = 1]$)

- Again, our skeptic could argue  Lambeth $\neq$ S&V 

---
## Difference in Differences

To address these concerns, Snow employed what we now call a difference-in-differences design, 

There are two, equivalent ways to view this design. 

$$\underbrace{\{E[Y_{i}(1)|D_{i} = 1] ‚àí E[Y_{i}(1)|D_{i} = 0]\}}_{\text{1. Treat-Control |Post }}‚àí \overbrace{\{E[Y_{i}(0)|D_{i} = 1] ‚àí E[Y_{i}(0)|D_{i}=0 ]}^{\text{Treated-Control|Pre}}$$

- Difference 1: Average change between Treated and Control  in Post Period
- Difference 2: Average change between Treated and Control  in Pre Period

Which is equivalent to:

$$\underbrace{\{E[Y_{i}(1)|D_{i} = 1] ‚àí E[Y_{i}(0)|D_{i} = 1]\}}_{\text{Post - Pre |Treated }}‚àí \overbrace{\{E[Y_{i}(1)|D_{i} = 0] ‚àí E[Y_{i}(0)|D_{i}=0 ]}^{\text{Post-Pre|Control}}$$


- Difference 1: Average change between Treated over time
- Difference 2: Average change between Control over time

---
## Difference in Differences


You'll see the DiD design represented both ways, but they produce the same result:

$$
\tau_{ATT} = (19-147) - (85-135) = -78
$$

$$
\tau_{ATT} = (19-85) - (147-135) = -78
$$

---
## Identifying Assumption of a Difference in Differences Design

The key assumption in this design is what's known as the parallel trends assumption: $E[Y_{0i}(1) ‚àí Y_{0i}(0)|D_i = 1] = E[Y_{0i}(1) ‚àí Y_{0i}(0)|D_i = 0]$ 

- In words: If Lambeth hadn't moved its pumps, it would have followed a similar path as S&V

---
```{r paralleltrends, echo=F, fig.height=4}

snow_g <- tibble(
  Period = c(0,0,3,3,0,3),
  Treatment = c(0,1,0, 1,1,1),
  Line = c(1,1,1,1,2,2),
  Company = c("S&V","Lambeth","S&V","Lambeth","Lambeth (D=0)","Lambeth (D=0)"),
  Deaths = c(135,85,147,19,85,97)
)

snow_g %>%
  ggplot(aes(Period,Deaths,col = Company))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_line()+
  geom_segment(aes(x=3.1,xend=3.1,y=19,yend=147), linetype = 2, col= "gray")+
  annotate(geom="text",x = 3.3,y=125, label = "1",hjust=.5)+
  geom_segment(aes(x=3.2,xend=3.2,y=19,yend=97), linetype = 2,col="gray")+
  annotate(geom="text",x = 3.3,y=55, label = "3",hjust=-.5)+
  geom_segment(aes(x=-.1,xend=-.1,y=85,yend=135), linetype = 2,col="gray")+
  annotate(geom="text",x = -.1,y=120, label = "2",hjust=1.5)+
  xlim(-2,6)+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0,3),labels = c("Pre","Post"))+
  theme_bw() -> snow_p

snow_p


```


Where:

1. $E[Y_{i}(1)|D_{i} = 1] ‚àí E[Y_{i}(1)|D_{i} = 0]$
2. $E[Y_{i}(0)|D_{i} = 1] ‚àí E[Y_{i}(0)|D_{i}\} = 0]$
3. $E[Y_{1i}(1) ‚àí Y_{0i}(1)|D_{i} = 1]$


---
## Summary

- A Difference in Differences (DiD, or diff-in-diff) design combines a pre-post comparison, with a treated and control comparison
  
  - Taking the pre-post difference removes any fixed differences between the units
  
  - Then taking the difference between treated and control differences removes any common differences over time

- The key identifying assumption of a DiD design is the "assumption of parallel trends"
  - Absent treatment, treated and control groups
would see the same changes over time.
  - Hard to prove, possible to test


---
## Extensions and limitations

- DiD easy to estimate with linear regression
- Generalizes to multiple periods and treatment interventions
  - More pre-treatment periods allow you assess "parallel trends" assumption
- Alternative methods 
  - Synthetic control
  - Event Study Designs
- What if you have multiple treatments or treatments that come and go?
  - Panel Matching
  - Generalized Synthetic control

## Logic of the Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) 

- What's the effect of holding elected office in the UK on personal wealth?

- People who win elections differ in many ways from people who lose elections.

- Logic of an RDD: 

  - Just look at the wealth of individuals who either narrowly won or lost elections.

  - Candidates close to 50 percent cutoff (discontinuity) should be more comparable (better counterfactuals)

## RDD Notation

- $X$ is a **forcing** variable
- Treatment $D$ is a determined by $X$

$$
D_i = 1\{X_i > c\}
$$

- $X$ is the `margin` variable in the example data, and $D=1$ if `margin` is greater than 0 (i.e. the candidate won the election)

- Interested in the differences in the outcome at the threshold

$$\lim_{x \downarrow  c} E[Y_i|X=x] - \lim_{x \uparrow  c} E[Y_i|X=x]$$

---
## Causal Identification with an RDD

If we assume $E[Y_i(0)|X=x]$ and $E[Y_i(1)|X=x]$ are continuous in x, then we can estimate a (local) ATE at the threshold:

$$\begin{align}
ATE_{RDD} &= E[Y(1)-Y(0)|X_i=c] \\
&=  E[Y(1)|X_i=c] -  E[Y(0)|X_i=c]\\
&= \lim_{x \downarrow  c} E[Y_i|X=x] - \lim_{x \uparrow  c} E[Y_i|X=x] \\
\end{align}$$

## Continuity Assumption

```

[Cunningham (2022)](https://mixtape.scunning.com/regression-discontinuity.html#continuity-assumption)

---
## Causal Identification with an RDD

- The continuity assumption is a formal way of saying that observations close to the threshold are good counterfactuals for each other

- We can't prove this assumption

- But if it holds, we should observe
 
  - no sorting around the cutoff (no self selection)
 
  - similar distributions of covariates around the cutoff (balance tests)
  
  - no effect of treatment on things measured pre-treatment (placebo tests)

## Instrumental Variables

## Instrumental Variables

Instrumental variables are an economists favorite tool for dealing with **omitted variable bias**

- We have some non random treatment whose effects we'd like to assess
- We're worried that these effects are **confounded** by some unobserved, omitted variable, that influences both the treatment and the outcome
- We find an **instrumental variable** that satisfies the following:
  - Randomization
  - Excludability
  - First-stage relatioship
  - Monotonicity
- Allowing us estimate a Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE) using the only the variation in our treatment is **exogenous** (uncorrelated with ommited variables)

With a binary treatment, $D$ and binary instrument $Z$ there are four types of compliance

```{r compliance, echo=F}
comp_tab <- tibble(
  Type = c("Always Takers",
           "Never Takers",
           "Compliers",
           "Defiers"),
   '$D_i(Z=1)$' = c(1,0,1,0),
   '$D_i(Z=0)$' = c(1,0,0,1)
)
kable(comp_tab)
```

- Assuming Monotonicity means there are "No Defiers"

---
## Estimating the Local Average Treatment Effect

If we believe our assumptions of:

- Randomization
- Excludability
- First-stage relationship
- Monotonicity

Then we can estimate Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE) sometimes called the Complier Average Treatment Effect CATE) 

---
## Estimating the Local Average Treatment Effect

It can be [shown](https://www.mattblackwell.org/files/teaching/s10-iv-handout.pdf) that the LATE:

$$LATE = \frac{E[Y|Z=1] - E[Y|Z=0]}{E[D|Z=1]-E[D|Z=0]}= \frac{ATE_{Z\to Y}}{ATE_{Z\to D}}$$

## Example: Earnings and Military Service

Adapted from [Edward Rubin](https://raw.githack.com/edrubin/EC421W19/master/LectureNotes/11InstrumentalVariables/11_instrumental_variables.html#42)

*Example:* If we want to estimate the effect of veteran status on earnings,
$$\begin{align}
  \text{Earnings}_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Veteran}_i + u_i \tag{1}
\end{align}$$

--

We would love to calculate $\color{#e64173}{\text{Earnings}_{1i}} - \color{#6A5ACD}{\text{Earnings}_{0i}}$, but we can't.

--

And OLS will likely be biased for $(1)$ due to selection/omitted-variable bias.

---

## Introductory example

Imagine that we can split veteran status into an exogenous (as-if random, unbiased) part and an endogenous (non-random, biased) part...

--

$$\begin{align}
  \text{Earnings}_i
  &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Veteran}_i + u_i \tag{1} \\
  &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 \left(\text{Veteran}_i^{\text{Exog.}} + \text{Veteran}_i^{\text{Endog.}}\right) + u_i \\
  &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Veteran}_i^{\text{Exog.}} + \underbrace{\beta_1 \text{Veteran}_i^{\text{Endog.}} + u_i}_{w_i} \\
  &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Veteran}_i^{\text{Exog.}} + w_i
\end{align}$$

--

We could use this exogenous variation in veteran status to consistently estimate $\beta_1$.

--

**Q:** What would exogenous variation in veteran status mean?

---

## Introductory example

**Q:** What would exogenous variation in veteran status mean?

--

**A.sub[1]:** Choices to enlist in the military that are essentially random‚Äîor at least uncorrelated with omitted variables and the disturbance.

--

**A.sub[2]:** .No selection bias:
$$\begin{align}
  \color{#e64173}{\mathop{E}\left(\text{Earnings}_{0i}\mid\text{Veteran}_i = 1\right)} - \color{#6A5ACD}{\mathop{E}\left( \text{Earnings}_{0i} \mid \text{Veteran}_i = 0 \right)} = 0
\end{align}$$

---
## Instruments

**Q:** How do we isolate this *exogenous variation* in our explanatory variable?
--
<br>**A:** Find an instrument (an instrumental variable).

--

**Q:** What's an instrument?
--
<br>**A:** An **instrument** is a variable that is

1. **correlated** with the **explanatory variable** of interest (*relevant*),
2. **uncorrelated** with the **error** term (*exogenous*).

---

## Instruments


So if we want an instrument $z_i$ for endogenous veteran status in

$$\begin{align}
  \text{Earnings}_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Veteran}_i + u_i
\end{align}$$

1. **Relevant:** $\mathop{\text{Cov}} \left( \text{Veteran}_i,\, z_i \right) \neq 0$
2. **Exogenous:** $\mathop{\text{Cov}} \left( z_i,\, u_i \right) = 0$

---
## Instruments: Relevance

**Relevance:** We need the instrument to cause a change in (correlate with) our endogenous explanatory variable.

We can actually test this requirement using regression and a *t* test.

--

***Example:*** For the veteran status, consider three potential instruments:

.pull-left[
1. Social security number

2. Physical fitness

3. Vietnam War draft
]

--

.pull-right[ 
- **Probably not relevant** uncorrelated with military service

- *Potentially relevant* service may correlate with fitness

- **Relevant** being drafted led to service
]

---


## Instruments: Exogeneity

.hi[Exogeneity:] The instrument to be independent of omitted factors that affect our outcome variable‚Äîas good as randomly assigned.

$z_i$ must be uncorrelated with our disturbance $u_i$. .hi[Not testable.]

--

***Example:*** For the .pink[veteran status], consider three potential instruments:

.pull-left[
1. Social security number

2. Physical fitness

3. Vietnam War draft
]

--

.pull-right[ 
- **Exogenous** SSN essentially random

- *Not Exogenous* fitness correlated with many things

- **Exogenous** draft via lottery

## IV Summary

Instrumental variables require a number of assumptions to yield credible causal claims:

- Randomization
- Excludability
- First-stage relationship
- Monotonicity

Estimation and inference of IVs is beyond the scope of this course. 

  - See Edward Rubin's excellent [slides](https://raw.githack.com/edrubin/EC421W19/master/LectureNotes/11InstrumentalVariables/11_instrumental_variables.html#85)
  - And Matt Blackwells [notes](https://www.mattblackwell.org/files/teaching/s10-iv-handout.pdf)

- Understanding the identifying assumptions of IV can help you critique a study (even if the you don't fully understand the math)
