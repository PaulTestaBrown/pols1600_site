<div id="about" class="section level1">
<h1>About</h1>
<p>This is a <em>sample</em> book written in <strong>Markdown</strong>. You can use anything that Pandoc’s Markdown supports; for example, a math equation <span class="math inline">\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\)</span>.</p>
<div id="usage" class="section level2">
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Each <strong>bookdown</strong> chapter is an .Rmd file, and each .Rmd file can contain one (and only one) chapter. A chapter <em>must</em> start with a first-level heading: <code># A good chapter</code>, and can contain one (and only one) first-level heading.</p>
<p>Use second-level and higher headings within chapters like: <code>## A short section</code> or <code>### An even shorter section</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>index.Rmd</code> file is required, and is also your first book chapter. It will be the homepage when you render the book.</p>
</div>
<div id="render-book" class="section level2">
<h2>Render book</h2>
<p>You can render the HTML version of this example book without changing anything:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Find the <strong>Build</strong> pane in the RStudio IDE, and</p></li>
<li><p>Click on <strong>Build Book</strong>, then select your output format, or select “All formats” if you’d like to use multiple formats from the same book source files.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Or build the book from the R console:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>bookdown::render_book()</code></pre>
<p>To render this example to PDF as a <code>bookdown::pdf_book</code>, you’ll need to install XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): <a href="https://yihui.org/tinytex/" class="uri">https://yihui.org/tinytex/</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="preview-book" class="section level2">
<h2>Preview book</h2>
<p>As you work, you may start a local server to live preview this HTML book. This preview will update as you edit the book when you save individual .Rmd files. You can start the server in a work session by using the RStudio add-in “Preview book,” or from the R console:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>bookdown::serve_book()</code></pre>
