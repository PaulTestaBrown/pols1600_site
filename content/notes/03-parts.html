<h1>Parts</h1>
<p>You can add parts to organize one or more book chapters together. Parts can be inserted at the top of an .Rmd file, before the first-level chapter heading in that same file.</p>
<p>Add a numbered part: <code># (PART) Act one {-}</code> (followed by <code># A chapter</code>)</p>
<p>Add an unnumbered part: <code># (PART\*) Act one {-}</code> (followed by <code># A chapter</code>)</p>
<p>Add an appendix as a special kind of un-numbered part: <code># (APPENDIX) Other stuff {-}</code> (followed by <code># A chapter</code>). Chapters in an appendix are prepended with letters instead of numbers.</p>
