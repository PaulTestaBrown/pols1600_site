## Motivating Example

Provide an image or anecdote that can help your audience understand what they're going to learn about

## Research Question

Provide a concise summary of your project's core question(s)



## Theory

- Use this section to explain how we should think about how to answer your research question

- What explains variation in your outcome?

## Expectations

- Translate your theory into a set of testable empirical implications

## Data

Summarize your data:

- Source(s)
  - Unit of analysis
  - Number of observations (periods of observation)

- Measures of:
  - Outcomes
  - Key Predictors
  - Covariates

## Descriptive Summary

- Provide a figure or table that provides a nice overview or insight into your data

## Design

Describe your empirical design

- Present at least one of the models you estimate

$$
\text{Outcome} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{predictor}
$$

- Explain to your audience what your theory implies for the sign, size, and signficance of the coefficients


## Results{.smaller}

## Summary

- Summarize the results of your analysis

- Interpret the coefficients from your models in terms of the predictions of your theory

## Table

Put a screen shot of a regression table here

- Or you could generate the table by including your paper's code and analysis in these slides

## Figure

Put a figure here
