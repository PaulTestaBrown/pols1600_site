# Goals and Expectations

## What you will learn

You will learn

. . .

-   how to think like a social scientist

. . .

. . .

-   how to use data to make descriptive, predictive, and causal claims

. . .

. . .

-   how to quantify uncertainty about these claims

. . .

. . .

## Reasons to take this class {.incremental}

1.  You want to change the world

## Why is this study important?

. . .

-   Findings provide evidence of benefits of social spending/universal basic income

## Why should we believe these results

::: incremental
-   Because it's in the *Times*?

-   Because the authors are professors at *good* schools?

-   Because of how the study was done!

    -   **Random assignment** provides a reasoned basis for inference
    -   Creates informative **counter-factual comparisons**
    -   **Pre-registered hypotheses** ensure that we're not cherry-picking results
:::

## Why might we be skeptical of these results?

::: incremental
-   How strong are the effects?
    -   Is a fifth of a standard deviation a lot?
-   Why do we care about brain waves?
-   What's the mechanism?
-   How confident are we that these results couldn't have happened just by chance

## Getting set up for the course:

Here's a [link to a guide](../resources/00-software-setup.qmd) to get you setup for the course.

Take a crack at it after class, over the weekend.

Email me with any issues (there are always issues), and drop by my office hours on Tuesday so we can trouble shoot.

## Textbook

```{r}
#| echo = F,
#| out.width = "40%"
knitr::include_graphics("https://pup-assets.imgix.net/onix/images/9780691222288.jpg?w=1500&auto=format")
```

<https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691222288/quantitative-social-science>

## How to Read Imai

-   Active reading

-   Copy and run the code in the text. To do so, do the following:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
if (!require("devtools")){
  install.packages("devtools")
  }
library("devtools")
install_github("kosukeimai/qss-package",  
               build_vignettes  =  TRUE)
```

## How to Read Imai

Once you've rune the following

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
install.packages("devtools")
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("kosukeimai/qss-package", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

Anywhere the text loads data:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
afghan <- read_csv("afgahn.csv")
```

You can do

```{r}
#| echo: true
library("qss")
data("afghan")
summary(afghan$age)
```

## Additional Readings

-   Occasionally, I will provide additional readings, available on both Canvas and [pols1600.paultesta.org](https://pols1600.paultesta.org)

# Assignments

## Assignments

You have three types of assignments in this course

#| echo = F,
#| out.width = 500
knitr::include_graphics("images/cw1.png")
```

## Labs

```{r}
#| echo = F,
#| out.width = 500
knitr::include_graphics("images/cw3.png")

    -   100% if correct
    -   85% if incorrect, but you tried
    -   0% if you did not try/absent for the lab
-   Comments/Answers posted immediately after class

## Problem Sets/Tutorials

# Introductions

## Two Fundamental Truths

## Testa's first fundamental truth

. . .

![](https://elephant.art/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/poop-emoji.jpg){width="50%"}

## Testa's first fundamental truth

Why would I profess my utter ignorance on the first day of class?

Four possible reasons...

## 1. Expectation Management

```{r}
#| echo = F,
#| out.width = "50%"
knitr::include_graphics("https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/643/247/199.png")
```

## 2. Pedagogical Tomfoolery

```{r}
#| echo = F,
#| out.width = "50%"
knitr::include_graphics("https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MpA2HVftSFntl9HhmhlQA3MEjIU=/0x0:1409x785/1200x800/filters:focal(622x252:846x476)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/55701647/Screen_Shot_2017_07_13_at_1.09.20_PM.0.png")
```

## 3. Positionality

```{r}
#| out.width = "20%",
#| echo = F
knitr::include_graphics("images/prettyfly.jpeg")
```

## 4. Epistemology

## Introductions

![](images/officehours.jpg)

## My research

-   I study American Poltical Behavior with focus on poltics of race and criminal justice
-   How do we break cycles of inequality when those most affected by injustice are the least likely to participate and those unaffected are the least likely to care?
-   How can we use methodological tools to better answer these questions?

## But enough about me
