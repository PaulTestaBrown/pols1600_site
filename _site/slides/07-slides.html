<li><p>The coefficients in a regression model define a formula which produces a predcited value of the outcome <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> when the predictors <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> take particular values.</p></li>
<li><p>To produce predicted values, we simply need to plug in values for each <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, multiply them by their corresponding coefficents, <span class="math inline">\(\beta_x\)</span> and ad them together.</p></li>

<h2>Producing Predicted Values in R</h2>
<p>The basic steps to producing predicted values in R as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Fit a model</li>
<li>Produce a <strong>prediction data frame</strong>, where one (sometimes two) predictor(s) vary, and others are held constant at a single value</li>
<li>Use prediction data frame to obtain predicted values from model using the <code>predict()</code> function</li>
<li>Plot predicted values to help interpret your model</li>

<h2>Interpretting our model</h2>
<p>So the coefficient on <code>percent_vaccinated</code> is negative, while the coefficient on <code>I(percent_vaccinated^2)</code> is positive.</p>
<p>This implies that the relationship between vaccination rates and Covid-19 deaths is not constant, but <strong>changes with the percent of population vaccinated.</strong></p>
<p>To help interpreted this model, let’s <strong>create a prediction data frame.</strong></p>

<h1>Summary producing predicted values from regression models</h1>
<ul>
<li>Predicted values help provide substantive interpretations of linear models</li>
</ul>
<p>–</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To produce predicted values we create <strong>prediction dataframes</strong> which generally vary one key predictor(s) predictors in the model constant at fixed values (typically their mean or modal values)</p></li>
<li><p>We create prediction data frames (e.g.&nbsp;<code>pred_df</code>) using <code>expand_grid()</code></p></li>
<li><p>We generate predicted values using the <code>predict()</code> function and save the predictions back into the prediction data frame (e.g.&nbsp;<code>pred_df$fit &lt;- predict(m, newdata = pred_df)</code>) so we can display the predictions graphically.</p></li>
