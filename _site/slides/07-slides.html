<li><p>In a simple, bivariate regression, the predicted values are the points are the points along the line defined by the intercept <span class="math inline">\(\beta_0\)</span> and the ‚Äúslope‚Äù <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>When we add predictors, we are adding dimensions to our model. In a model, with two predictors, the predicted values are descibed by a <em>plane</em></p></li>
<li><p>With more than two predictors, the predicted values fall along a <em>hyperplane</em> that likely requires some mind altering substances to visualize.</p></li>
<li><p>In practice, to interpret mutliple regression models, we will produce predicted values for <em>a range of one variable</em>, holding other predictors constant at some typical value (what‚Äôs a good typical value?)</p></li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="producing-predicted-values-in-r">Producing Predicted Values in R</h2>
<p>The basic steps to producing predicted values in R as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Fit a model</li>
<li>Produce a <strong>prediction data frame</strong>, where one (sometimes two) predictor(s) vary, and others are held constant at a single value</li>
<li>Use prediction data frame to obtain predicted values from model using the <code>predict()</code> function</li>
<li>Plot predicted values to help interpret your model</li>
</ol>
<p>Let‚Äôs demo this using the lab data.</p>

<p><span class="math display">\[\text{Deaths} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{% Vaxxed} + + \beta_1 \text{% Vaxxed}^2 + \episolon\]</span></p>

<h1>Summary producing predicted values from regression models</h1>
<ul>
<li>Predicted values help provide substantive interpretations of linear models</li>
</ul>
<p>‚Äì</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To produce predicted values we create <strong>prediction dataframes</strong> which generally vary one key predictor(s) predictors in the model constant at fixed values (typically their mean or modal values)</p></li>
<li><p>We create prediction data frames (e.g.&nbsp;<code>pred_df</code>) using <code>expand_grid()</code></p></li>
<li><p>We generate predicted values using the <code>predict()</code> function and save the predictions back into the prediction data frame (e.g.&nbsp;<code>pred_df$fit &lt;- predict(m, newdata = pred_df)</code>) so we can display the predictions graphically.</p></li>
