So by collapsing negative and positive values of facial_coverings to construct our face_mask variable, we’re probably over stating the extent the extensiveness of policies in effect.\nSo we should be cautious in how we interpret our collapsed variable, face_mask. Perhaps we could construct another variable that distinguished state-level policies from more localized policies, or we could only look at cases where there was a uniform state policy."

    "text": "8.1 Measures of Central Tendency\nMeasures of central tendency describe what a typical value of some variable. In this course, we’ll use three measures of what’s typical:\n\nmean\nmedian\nmode\n\n\n8.1.1 Mean\nOne of the most frequent measures of central tendency we’ll use in this course is a mean or average.\nSuppose we have \\(n\\) observations of some variable \\(x\\). We can calculate the mean of \\(\\bar{x}\\) (“x bar), by adding up all the values of x\n[ {x}=_{i=1}^n x_i ]\nWe’ll see later in the course that means are closely related to the concept of expected values in probability and that conditional means (which we’ll calculate below) are central to thinking about linear regression.\nFor now, please calculate the mean (average) number of new cases per 100,000 residents in our data:\n\nmean(covid_us$new_cases_pc, na.rm=T)\n\n[1] 28.11486\n\n\nLast class, when we calculated the the average number of new cases under each type of face mask policy, we were calculating a conditional mean the mean of some variable, conditional on some other variable taking a specific value.\nFormally, you’ll often see this written in terms of Expected Values: Something like\n[ E[Y|X=x] ]\nOr to make it more concrete:\n[ E[ | ] ]\nIn code, we could accomplish this manually, using the index operator:\n\nmean(covid_us$new_cases_pc[covid_us$face_masks == \"No policy\"], na.rm=T)\n\n[1] 10.26168\n\n\n\n8.1.1.1 How would we calculate the conditional mean of new_cases_pc when face_masks equals “Recommend”\n\nmean(covid_us$new_cases_pc[covid_us$face_masks == \"Recommended\"], na.rm=T)\n\n[1] 16.61408\n\n\nBy using group_by() with summarise() we can accomplish this more quickly:\n\ncovid_us%&gt;%\n  group_by(face_masks)%&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    new_cases_pc = mean(new_cases_pc, na.rm=T)\n  )\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 2\n  face_masks             new_cases_pc\n  &lt;fct&gt;                         &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 No policy                      10.3\n2 Recommended                    16.6\n3 Some requirements              36.2\n4 Required shared places         29.4\n5 Required all times             32.2\n6 &lt;NA&gt;                           11.8\n\n\n\n\n\n8.1.2 Median\nThe median is another measure of what’s typical for variables that take numeric values\nImagine, we took our data new Covid-19 cases and arranged them in ascending order, from the smallest value to highest value\nThe median would be the value in the exact middle of that sequence, also known as the 50th percentile.1\nFormally, we can define that median as:\n[ M_x = X_i : ^{x_i} f_x(X)dx=^f_x(X)dx=1/2 ]\nWhich might look like Greek to you, which is fine. Just think of it as the middle value.\n\n8.1.2.1 Please calculate the median number of new Covid-19 cases per 100,000 using the median() function. How does it compare to the mean?\n\nmedian(covid_us$new_cases_pc, na.rm=T)\n\n[1] 10.52355\n\n\nInteresting the median is much lower than the mean. If we were to look at a histogram of our data (more on that next week; think of it as a graphical representation of a frequency table), we see that the new_cases_pc has a “long tail” or is skewed to the right. Most of the values are close to 0, but there are few cases that are extreme outliers.\n\n\nMedians are less influenced by outliers than means\n\n\n\nhist(covid_us$new_cases_pc, breaks = 100)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.1.3 Modes\nConceptually, a mode describes the most frequent outcome.\nModes are useful for describing what’s typical of “nominal” or categorical data like our measure of face mask policy.\nTo calculate the mode of our face_masks variable, wrap the output of table() with the sort() function\n\nsort(table(covid_us$face_masks))\n\n\n    Required all times              No policy            Recommended \n                  1032                   3893                   8879 \nRequired shared places      Some requirements \n                 15088                  24786 \n\n\nFor numeric data, modes correspond to the peak of a variable’s density function (more on this later in the class).\nYou can get a sense of the relationship between, means, median’s and modes from this helpful figure from Wikipedia:\n\nknitr::include_graphics(\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Visualisation_mode_median_mean.svg/240px-Visualisation_mode_median_mean.svg.png\")"

Lots of things are changing and these month comparisons are by no means perfect. Lot’s of things differ between states with different mask policies. What we’d really like to know is a sort of counterfactual comparison between the number new cases in a state with a given policy and what those new cases would have been had that state had a different policy.\nThe problem is, we don’t get to see that counterfactual outcome. So how can we make causal claims about the effects of facemasks, or any other policy that interests us? Finding creative ways to answer these questions is the key to making credible causal claims.\nNext week, we’ll explore how to make this figure and many more from our data"

In this course, we’ll use three measures of what’s typical:\n\nmean\nmedian\nmode\n\n\n8.1.1 Mean\nOne of the most frequent measures of central tendency we’ll use in this course is a mean or average.\nSuppose we have \\(n\\) observations of some variable \\(x\\). We can calculate the mean of \\(\\bar{x}\\) (“x bar), by adding up all the values of x\n[ {x}=_{i=1}^n x_i ]\nWe’ll see later in the course that means are closely related to the concept of expected values in probability and that conditional means (which we’ll calculate below) are central to thinking about linear regression.\nFor now, please calculate the mean (average) number of new cases per 100,000 residents in our data:\nLast class, when we calculated the the average number of new cases under each type of face mask policy, we were calculating a conditional mean the mean of some variable, conditional on some other variable taking a specific value.\nFormally, you’ll often see this written in terms of Expected Values: Something like\n[ E[Y|X=x] ]\nOr to make it more concrete:\n[ E[ | ] ]\nIn code, we could accomplish this manually, using the index operator:\n\n# mean(covid_us$new_cases_pc[covid_us$face_masks == \"No policy\"], na.rm=T)\n\n\n8.1.1.1 How would we calculate the conditional mean of new_cases_pc when face_masks equals “Recommended”\nBy using group_by() with summarise() we can accomplish this more quickly:\n\n# covid_us%&gt;%\n#   group_by(face_masks)%&gt;%\n#   summarise(\n#     new_cases_pc = mean(new_cases_pc, na.rm=T)\n#   )\n\n\n\n\n8.1.2 Median\nThe median is another measure of what’s typical for variables that take numeric values\nImagine, we took our data new Covid-19 cases and arranged them in ascending order, from the smallest value to highest value\nThe median would be the value in the exact middle of that sequence, also known as the 50th percentile.1\nFormally, we can define that median as:\n[ M_x = X_i : ^{x_i} f_x(X)dx=^f_x(X)dx=1/2 ]\nWhich might look like Greek to you, which is fine. Just think of it as the middle value.\n\n8.1.2.1 Please calculate the median number of new Covid-19 cases per 100,000 using the median() function. How does it compare to the mean?\n\n\nMedians are less influenced by outliers than means\n\n\n\n\n\n8.1.3 Modes\nConceptually, a mode describes the most frequent outcome.\nModes are useful for describing what’s typical of “nominal” or categorical data like our measure of face mask policy.\nTo calculate the mode of our face_masks variable, wrap the output of table() with the sort() function\n\n# sort(table(covid_us$face_masks))\n\nFor numeric data, modes correspond to the peak of a variable’s density function (more on this later in the class).\nYou can get a sense of the relationship between, means, median’s and modes from this helpful figure from Wikipedia:\n\nknitr::include_graphics(\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Visualisation_mode_median_mean.svg/240px-Visualisation_mode_median_mean.svg.png\")"

    "text": "9.2 Add another filter to the code above to caluclate the conditional means for just 1 month in a particular year in the data\nIf we limit our comparison to a more narrow time period, say one month in one year, we’re making a fairer comparison between states that are likely facing more similar conditions/challenges.\n\n9.2.1 Add another arguement to the group_by() command from the original code to calcutate the conditional means by face mask policy for each month in each year of the data\n\nSave the output of summarize into an object called cases_by_month_and_policy\n\n\n\n9.2.2 Uncomment the code below to display cases_by_month_and_policy in a searchable table\n\n# DT::datatable(cases_by_month_and_policy,\n#               filter = \"top\")\n\n\n\n9.2.3 Uncomment the code below to visualize this cases_by_month_and_policy\nWhat does this figure tell us?\n\n# cases_by_month_and_policy %&gt;%\n#   ggplot(aes(\n#     x= year_month,\n#     y = new_cases_pc,\n#     col=face_masks))+\n#   geom_point()+coord_flip()\n\nSo this figure graphically displays the data cases_by_month_and_policy\nFrom about August 2020 to October 2020 states with facemask requirements saw much lower rates of new cases than states that only recommended face masks.\nAfter October 2020, every state has at least some requirement, and the differences between the stringency of requirements is a little harder to see.\nAgain this stuff is complicated. Lots of things are changing and these month comparisons are by no means perfect. Lot’s of things differ between states with different mask policies. What we’d really like to know is a sort of counterfactual comparison between the number new cases in a state with a given policy and what those new cases would have been had that state had a different policy.\nThe problem is, we don’t get to see that counterfactual outcome. So how can we make causal claims about the effects of facemasks, or any other policy that interests us? Finding creative ways to answer these questions is the key to making credible causal claims.\nNext week, we’ll explore how to make this figure and many more from our data"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Asking a good research question is one of the most important skills you will develop in your academic careers. It’s also one of the hardest.\nWe often think we’re asking one question, when in fact the study we conduct really addresses a related but distinct question. When a priest asked Willie Sutton why he robbed banks, he replied the “Well, that’s where the money is”. The priest’s question was about why rob at all, while Sutton answered the different question “Given one robs, why rob banks?” Similarly, Medieval philosophers might ask why objects stay in motion, while Newton suggests what really need is not an explanation of motion itself but of changes in motion.\nThe object of our question shapes the form of our explanation.\nIn this assignment, I would like your group to craft three potential research questions that we might explore in our research project for this class. Each question, should be a single sentence, with a few sentences answering the following questions (More details below):\n\nWhy do we care about the answer to this research question?\nWhat’s would a hypothetical “ideal experiment” to answer this question look like?\nWhat would a study with observational data look like?\nA published study that relates to this question\nHow feasible would it be to do a study like this for the course\n\nYou may use this Rmd file as a template (click here to download) or create your own file. Please submit your responses to Canvas.\nYou might start by writing down several questions of different forms about the same topic:\n\nWhy do people vote?\nWhy do people not vote?\nWhy do the rich vote at higher rates than the poor?\nWhen might people who don’t vote, be motivated to vote?\nWhat is the effect of encouraging someone to vote via a phone call?\nAre phone calls more or less effective than in-person contact for get-out the vote efforts?\n\nEach of these questions addresses a general topic that political scientists seem to think is important. Each carries some suppositions and assumptions that in turn influence the type of explanation we might find convincing. Why do people vote feels a bit broad to me. People probably vote for many reasons. How can we hope to adjudicate between all the possible reasons for voting? (Further are these the same reasons for not voting or do we need another set of explanations altogether?)\nWhether phone calls are more or less effective than in-person contacts for GOTV efforts seems more tractable, but also perhaps to narrow. Do we really care? If we’re confident we can identify an effect or difference in one study, are we sure we’ll see similar effects in a different study conducted under different circumstances?\nIn crafting your research questions, you want to strike a balance between things we actually care about (why do people vote) and things we can actually assess (what’s effect of a particularly type of encouragement to vote). A few thoughts on this process:\n\n“Why” questions tend to be more compelling than “What” or “How” or “Do” questions, I think in part because “why” questions often imply a theory and suggest a counterfactual (why this and not that), while other ways of asking questions feel more descriptive. For example, why do the rich vote at higher rates than the poor. Well, one explanation may be that their relative social and economic status means they are more likely to be targets of mobilization efforts by campaigns (among many things). So a natural follow up to this larger question might be, what’s the effect of providing similar mobilization efforts to the poor. Would they vote at similar rates to the rich? If so, then we’ve learned something about how mobilization explains class differences in participation.\nThinking about questions in terms of puzzles is another useful trick. Why do parties exist when politicians’ ideological preferences can explain the vast majority of their legislative behavior? Note this type of question contains a lot of presuppositions (how do we measure ideological preferences? Do they really explain legislative behavior? Is that what we care about?), but as point of departure for a study these type arguments can be useful\nTry to be simple and clear. Don’t worry about asking the perfect question right away. Your questions can and should evolve over time, and I suspect some of you will write a paper that has nothing to do with the questions you posed here.\n\nFor each question, please discuss the following:\n\nWhy do we care? Why we should care about the answer to this question. A strong justification is often that existing theories yield conflicting predictions and so your study will offer some insight into how to adjudicate betweeen these theories. A less strong justification is that no one has ever studied this before. Even if this is true (and it’s often not) it may be true for good reason. No need for formal citations, but if there are specific theories or claims your addressing feel free to name names.\nThe ideal experiment Please describe an “ideal” experiment that you could run that would give you some purchase on your question. Note the key feature of an experiment, is that you the researcher are able to manipulate (through random assignment) some facet of the world. Assume money, resources, physics, and even ethics are not an object. If you could randomly assign anything, what would you manipulate. At what level of analysis would your manipulation occur (i.e. are your units of analysis individuals or countries or something else). How would you measure your outcome, again assuming you were all power and all-seeing. If that manipulation isn’t feasible, what does that say about the ability to make a causal claim about your question?\nThe observational study Finally, considering some of the potential limitations that might prevent you from implementing your ideal experiment (it’s hard to randomly assign democratic government), what is one way you might address your research question with observational data. Would your study use cross-sectional or longitudinal data. What are some of the concerns (selection on observables) that arise in this setting. Is there a natural experiment or some sort of discontinuity you might leverage to approximate this experimental ideal.\n\nAgain, each paragraph should be brief and to the point. No need to specify a full research design–just give me the broad strokes. You’re writing for each question should not exceed a page.\nAfter you’ve thought through how you might go about answering your question, please find\n\nA published study that relates to this question. It need not be exactly your question as posed, but it should be in a similar area. Include a full citation, and link to the study. Then in a paragraph sentences try to summarize:\n\n\nThe study’s research question\nEmprical design\nCore findings.\n\nFinally on a scale of 1 (least feasible) to 10 (most feasible), please evaluate how likely you think it is you could write an empirical paper on this question for this course.\nDon’t worry about getting everything right. Your final projects can, will, and probably should change. The point of this exercise is to get some practice thinking about questions that interest you in the language of causal inference and potential outcomes."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Asking a good research question is one of the most important skills you will develop in your academic careers. It’s also one of the hardest.\nWe often think we’re asking one question, when in fact the study we conduct really addresses a related but distinct question. When a priest asked Willie Sutton why he robbed banks, he replied the “Well, that’s where the money is”. The priest’s question was about why rob at all, while Sutton answered the different question “Given one robs, why rob banks?” Similarly, Medieval philosophers might ask why objects stay in motion, while Newton suggests what really need is not an explanation of motion itself but of changes in motion.\nThe object of our question shapes the form of our explanation.\nIn this assignment, I would like your group to craft three potential research questions that we might explore in our research project for this class. Each question, should be a single sentence, with a few sentences answering the following questions (More details below):\n\nWhy do we care about the answer to this research question?\nWhat’s would a hypothetical “ideal experiment” to answer this question look like?\nWhat would a study with observational data look like?\nA published study that relates to this question\nHow feasible would it be to do a study like this for the course\n\nYou may use this Rmd file as a template (click here to download) or create your own file. Please submit your responses to Canvas.\nYou might start by writing down several questions of different forms about the same topic:\n\nWhy do people vote?\nWhy do people not vote?\nWhy do the rich vote at higher rates than the poor?\nWhen might people who don’t vote, be motivated to vote?\nWhat is the effect of encouraging someone to vote via a phone call?\nAre phone calls more or less effective than in-person contact for get-out the vote efforts?\n\nEach of these questions addresses a general topic that political scientists seem to think is important. Each carries some suppositions and assumptions that in turn influence the type of explanation we might find convincing. Why do people vote feels a bit broad to me. People probably vote for many reasons. How can we hope to adjudicate between all the possible reasons for voting? (Further are these the same reasons for not voting or do we need another set of explanations altogether?)\nWhether phone calls are more or less effective than in-person contacts for GOTV efforts seems more tractable, but also perhaps to narrow. Do we really care? If we’re confident we can identify an effect or difference in one study, are we sure we’ll see similar effects in a different study conducted under different circumstances?\nIn crafting your research questions, you want to strike a balance between things we actually care about (why do people vote) and things we can actually assess (what’s effect of a particularly type of encouragement to vote). A few thoughts on this process:\n\n“Why” questions tend to be more compelling than “What” or “How” or “Do” questions, I think in part because “why” questions often imply a theory and suggest a counterfactual (why this and not that), while other ways of asking questions feel more descriptive. For example, why do the rich vote at higher rates than the poor. Well, one explanation may be that their relative social and economic status means they are more likely to be targets of mobilization efforts by campaigns (among many things). So a natural follow up to this larger question might be, what’s the effect of providing similar mobilization efforts to the poor. Would they vote at similar rates to the rich? If so, then we’ve learned something about how mobilization explains class differences in participation.\nThinking about questions in terms of puzzles is another useful trick. Why do parties exist when politicians’ ideological preferences can explain the vast majority of their legislative behavior? Note this type of question contains a lot of presuppositions (how do we measure ideological preferences? Do they really explain legislative behavior? Is that what we care about?), but as point of departure for a study these type arguments can be useful\nTry to be simple and clear. Don’t worry about asking the perfect question right away. Your questions can and should evolve over time, and I suspect some of you will write a paper that has nothing to do with the questions you posed here.\n\nFor each question, please discuss the following:\n\nWhy do we care? Why we should care about the answer to this question. A strong justification is often that existing theories yield conflicting predictions and so your study will offer some insight into how to adjudicate betweeen these theories. A less strong justification is that no one has ever studied this before. Even if this is true (and it’s often not) it may be true for good reason. No need for formal citations, but if there are specific theories or claims your addressing feel free to name names.\nThe ideal experiment Please describe an “ideal” experiment that you could run that would give you some purchase on your question. Note the key feature of an experiment, is that you the researcher are able to manipulate (through random assignment) some facet of the world. Assume money, resources, physics, and even ethics are not an object. If you could randomly assign anything, what would you manipulate. At what level of analysis would your manipulation occur (i.e. are your units of analysis individuals or countries or something else). How would you measure your outcome, again assuming you were all power and all-seeing. If that manipulation isn’t feasible, what does that say about the ability to make a causal claim about your question?\nThe observational study Finally, considering some of the potential limitations that might prevent you from implementing your ideal experiment (it’s hard to randomly assign democratic government), what is one way you might address your research question with observational data. Would your study use cross-sectional or longitudinal data. What are some of the concerns (selection on observables) that arise in this setting. Is there a natural experiment or some sort of discontinuity you might leverage to approximate this experimental ideal.\n\nAgain, each paragraph should be brief and to the point. No need to specify a full research design–just give me the broad strokes. You’re writing for each question should not exceed a page.\nAfter you’ve thought through how you might go about answering your question, please find\n\nA published study that relates to this question. It need not be exactly your question as posed, but it should be in a similar area. Include a full citation, and link to the study. Then in a paragraph sentences try to summarize:\n\n\nThe study’s research question\nEmprical design\nCore findings.\n\nFinally on a scale of 1 (least feasible) to 10 (most feasible), please evaluate how likely you think it is you could write an empirical paper on this question for this course.\nDon’t worry about getting everything right. Your final projects can, will, and probably should change. The point of this exercise is to get some practice thinking about questions that interest you in the language of causal inference and potential outcomes.",
