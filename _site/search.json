    "text": "This class is an introduction to applied statistics as practiced in political science. It is computing intensive, and, as such, will enable students to execute basic quantitative analyses of social science data using the linear model with statistical inference arising from re-sampling and permutation based techniques as applied in the R statistical computing language with RStudio. By the end of the course, a successful student will be able to find social science data online, download it, analyze it, and write about how the analyses bear on focused social science or policy questions.\n\n\n\nMore than anything I assume a willingness to engage with mathematics, data analysis, computer programming, and the practice of social science thinking and writing. I also assume you’ve taken at least one class in algebra at the level taught in most high schools in the United States and have used a personal computer to read and type email and other documents and have some experience with the Internet.\nI also assume that you will read the syllabus and that you keep up to date on changes in the syllabus which will be announced in class. You should not expect a response to emails that ask a question already answered in the syllabus.\nThis is an experimental class so you should expect that the syllabus will change throughout the term. Make sure you have the syllabus with the latest date stamp. I will announce syllabus changes via the emails sent from Canvas.\n\n\n\nNeither the University nor I tolerate cheating or plagiarism. The Brown Writing Center defines plagiarism as ``appropriating another person’s ideas or words (spoken or written) without attributing those word or ideas to their true source.’’ The consequences for plagiarism are often severe, and can include suspension or expulsion. This course will follow the guidelines in the Academic Code for determining what is and isn’t plagiarism:\n\nIn preparing assignments a student often needs or is required to employ outside sources of information or opinion. All such sources should be listed in the bibliography. Citations and footnote references are required for all specific facts that are not common knowledge and about which there is not general agreement. New discoveries or debatable opinions must be credited to the source, with specific references to edition and page even when the student restates the matter in his or her own words. Word-for-word inclusion of any part of someone else’s written or oral sentence, even if only a phrase or sentence, requires citation in quotation marks and use of the appropriate conventions for attribution. Citations should normally include author, title, edition, and page. (Quotations longer than one sentence are generally indented from the text of the essay, without quotation marks, and identified by author, title, edition, and page.) Paraphrasing or summarizing the contents of another’s work is not dishonest if the source or sources are clearly identified (author, title, edition, and page), but such paraphrasing does not constitute independent work and may be rejected by the instructor. Students who have questions about accurate and proper citation methods are expected to consult reference guides as well as course instructors.\n\nWe will discuss specific information about your written work in class in more detail, but if you are unsure of how to properly cite material, please ask for clarification. If you are having difficulty with writing or would like more information or assistance, consult the Writing Center, the Brown library and/or the Academic Code for more information.\n\n\n\nAll students and the instructor must be respectful of others in the classroom. If you ever feel that the classroom environment is discouraging your participation or problematic in any way, please contact me.\n\n\n\nBrown University is committed to full inclusion of all students.

In terms of participation, I expect that you will come to class eager to learn and engage with that week’s topics. If you have a question, ask it. If you’re getting an error, share it. In some ways, your job is to make errors. To paraphrase Joyce: people of genius make no mistakes. Our errors are volitional and portals of discovery. While this experience can be challenging and frustrating, it is also incredibly rewarding. I fully expect you persevere through the problems and difficulties that inevitably arise in this course, and will do everything I can to help in this process."
