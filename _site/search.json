    "text": "This class is an introduction to applied statistics as practiced in political science. It is computing intensive, and, as such, will enable students to execute basic quantitative analyses of social science data using the linear model with statistical inference arising from re-sampling and permutation based techniques as applied in the R statistical computing language with RStudio. By the end of the course, a successful student will be able to find social science data online, download it, analyze it, and write about how the analyses bear on focused social science or policy questions.\n\n\n\nMore than anything I assume a willingness to engage with mathematics, data analysis, computer programming, and the practice of social science thinking and writing. I also assume you’ve taken at least one class in algebra at the level taught in most high schools in the United States and have used a personal computer to read and type email and other documents and have some experience with the Internet.\nI also assume that you will read the syllabus and that you keep up to date on changes in the syllabus which will be announced in class. You should not expect a response to emails that ask a question already answered in the syllabus.\nThis is an experimental class so you should expect that the syllabus will change throughout the term. Make sure you have the syllabus with the latest date stamp. I will announce syllabus changes via the emails sent from Canvas.\n\n\n\nNeither the University nor I tolerate cheating or plagiarism. The Brown Writing Center defines plagiarism as ``appropriating another person’s ideas or words (spoken or written) without attributing those word or ideas to their true source.’’ The consequences for plagiarism are often severe, and can include suspension or expulsion. This course will follow the guidelines in the Academic Code for determining what is and isn’t plagiarism:\n\nIn preparing assignments a student often needs or is required to employ outside sources of information or opinion. All such sources should be listed in the bibliography. Citations and footnote references are required for all specific facts that are not common knowledge and about which there is not general agreement. New discoveries or debatable opinions must be credited to the source, with specific references to edition and page even when the student restates the matter in his or her own words. Word-for-word inclusion of any part of someone else’s written or oral sentence, even if only a phrase or sentence, requires citation in quotation marks and use of the appropriate conventions for attribution. Citations should normally include author, title, edition, and page. (Quotations longer than one sentence are generally indented from the text of the essay, without quotation marks, and identified by author, title, edition, and page.) Paraphrasing or summarizing the contents of another’s work is not dishonest if the source or sources are clearly identified (author, title, edition, and page), but such paraphrasing does not constitute independent work and may be rejected by the instructor. Students who have questions about accurate and proper citation methods are expected to consult reference guides as well as course instructors.\n\nWe will discuss specific information about your written work in class in more detail, but if you are unsure of how to properly cite material, please ask for clarification. If you are having difficulty with writing or would like more information or assistance, consult the Writing Center, the Brown library and/or the Academic Code for more information.\n\n\n\nAll students and the instructor must be respectful of others in the classroom.

In terms of participation, I expect that you will come to class eager to learn and engage with that week’s topics. If you have a question, ask it. If you’re getting an error, share it. In some ways, your job is to make errors. To paraphrase Joyce: people of genius make no mistakes. Our errors are volitional and portals of discovery. While this experience can be challenging and frustrating, it is also incredibly rewarding. I fully expect you persevere through the problems and difficulties that inevitably arise in this course, and will do everything I can to help in this process."

Toss a fair coin 20 times; how many times does it come up heads? This count is an outcome that follows the binomial distribution.\nThe key parameters are the number of trials \\(n\\) and the probability of success for each trial \\(p\\) and the pdf of a binomial distribution is:\n\\[f(x)=\\binom{n}{x}p^x (1-p) ^{1-x} \\ \\text{for x 0,1,2},\\dots n\\] So if we were to toss a fair coin 20 times and count up the number of heads, the most common outcome would be 10 heads\n\nThe binomial distribution will come in handy when trying to model binary outcomes."

For example, x/y position, color, shape, and size. Aesthetic attributes are mapped to variables in the dataset.\ngeom: the geometric object in question.

    "text": "Story: Testing for Partisan Differences\n\nThe results from Model 1 provide little initial evidence for partisan differences in vaccine skepticism in the 2016 Election.\n\nThe coefficient on the partisanship variable is -0.005, suggesting that a unit increase in partisanship (going from being a Strong Democrat to just a Democrat, or an Independent to an independent who leans Republican), is associated with just a 0.5 percentage point increase in the probability of being a vaccine skeptic (believing that the risks of vaccination outweigh the benefits or that their is no difference in the risks versus benefits).\n\nFurthermore the 95-percent confidence interval for this estimate (-0.011, 0.002) brackets 0, suggesting the true population estimate from this model could be either positive or negative. Similarly, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the true coefficient on partisanship in this model is 0 as the test statistic for this estimate ( -1.38) corresponds to a p-value of 0.168 suggesting that we would see test statistics this large or larger fairly often when the true relationship was 0.\nIn some the results from Model 1 provide little support for any of the expectations described by H1"

In particular, you will get practice:\n\nCreating and recoding variables using mutate()\nCalculating a moving average or rolling mean using the rollmean() function from the zoo package\nTransforming the data on presidential elections so that it can be merged with the data on Covid-19 using the pivot_wider() function.\nMerging data together using the left_join() function.\n\nIn question 6, you will see how calculating conditional means provides a simple test of “Red Covid” claim.\nIn question 7, you will see how a linear model returns the same information as these conditional means (in a sligthly different format)\nIn question 8, you will get practice interpreting linear models with continuous predictors (i.e. predictors that take on a range of values)\nIn question 9, you will get practice visualizing these models and using the figures help interpret your results substantively.\nQuestion 10 asks you to play the role of a skeptic and consider what other factors might explain the relationships we found in Questions 6-9. We will explore these factors in next week’s lab.\n\nclass: inverse, center, middle background-image: url(“https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a2/05/b6/a205b689caf19f3287b1544cbe0e6b7b.jpg”) background-size: contain # 📢 ## Feedback\n\n\n# A tibble: 21 × 29\n   StartDate           EndDate             Status         IPAddress     Progress\n   &lt;dttm&gt;              &lt;dttm&gt;              &lt;dbl+lbl&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 2023-02-23 13:47:36 2023-02-23 13:49:09 0 [IP Address] 128.148.206.…      100\n 2 2023-02-23 13:47:34 2023-02-23 13:49:13 0 [IP Address] 128.148.207.…      100\n 3 2023-02-23 13:47:30 2023-02-23 13:49:17 0 [IP Address] 128.148.204.…      100\n 4 2023-02-23 13:47:32 2023-02-23 13:49:26 0 [IP Address] 128.148.204.…      100\n 5 2023-02-23 13:47:50 2023-02-23 13:49:35 0 [IP Address] 128.148.205.…      100\n 6 2023-02-23 13:47:17 2023-02-23 13:49:38 0 [IP Address] 192.91.235.1…      100\n 7 2023-02-23 13:48:03 2023-02-23 13:49:42 0 [IP Address] 128.148.205.…      100\n 8 2023-02-23 13:47:14 2023-02-23 13:49:48 0 [IP Address] 128.148.206.…      100\n 9 2023-02-23 13:47:33 2023-02-23 13:49:54 0 [IP Address] 128.148.207.…      100\n10 2023-02-23 13:47:49 2023-02-23 13:49:54 0 [IP Address] 128.148.207.…      100\n# ℹ 11 more rows\n# ℹ 24 more variables: Duration__in_seconds_ &lt;dbl&gt;, Finished &lt;dbl+lbl&gt;,\n#   RecordedDate &lt;dttm&gt;, ResponseId &lt;chr&gt;, RecipientLastName &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   RecipientFirstName &lt;chr&gt;, RecipientEmail &lt;chr&gt;, ExternalReference &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   LocationLatitude &lt;chr&gt;, LocationLongitude &lt;chr&gt;, DistributionChannel &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   UserLanguage &lt;chr&gt;, Likes &lt;chr&gt;, Dislikes &lt;chr&gt;, code_skills &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   code_challenge &lt;chr&gt;, eval_1 &lt;dbl&gt;, eval_2 &lt;dbl&gt;, eval_3 &lt;dbl&gt;, …"

    "text": "Asking a good research question is one of the most important skills you will develop in your academic careers. It’s also one of the hardest.\nWe often think we’re asking one question, when in fact the study we conduct really addresses a related but distinct question. When a priest asked Willie Sutton why he robbed banks, he replied the “Well, that’s where the money is”. The priest’s question was about why rob at all, while Sutton answered the different question “Given one robs, why rob banks?” Similarly, Medieval philosophers might ask why objects stay in motion, while Newton suggests what really need is not an explanation of motion itself but of changes in motion.\nThe object of our question shapes the form of our explanation.\nIn this assignment, I would like your group to craft three potential research questions that we might explore in our research project for this class. Each question, should be a single sentence, with a few sentences answering the following questions (More details below):\n\nWhy do we care about the answer to this research question?\nWhat’s would a hypothetical “ideal experiment” to answer this question look like?\nWhat would a study with observational data look like?\nA published study that relates to this question\nHow feasible would it be to do a study like this for the course\n\nYou may use this Rmd file as a template (click here to download) or create your own file. Please submit your responses to Canvas.\nYou might start by writing down several questions of different forms about the same topic:\n\nWhy do people vote?\nWhy do people not vote?\nWhy do the rich vote at higher rates than the poor?\nWhen might people who don’t vote, be motivated to vote?\nWhat is the effect of encouraging someone to vote via a phone call?\nAre phone calls more or less effective than in-person contact for get-out the vote efforts?\n\nEach of these questions addresses a general topic that political scientists seem to think is important. Each carries some suppositions and assumptions that in turn influence the type of explanation we might find convincing. Why do people vote feels a bit broad to me. People probably vote for many reasons. How can we hope to adjudicate between all the possible reasons for voting? (Further are these the same reasons for not voting or do we need another set of explanations altogether?)\nWhether phone calls are more or less effective than in-person contacts for GOTV efforts seems more tractable, but also perhaps to narrow. Do we really care? If we’re confident we can identify an effect or difference in one study, are we sure we’ll see similar effects in a different study conducted under different circumstances?\nIn crafting your research questions, you want to strike a balance between things we actually care about (why do people vote) and things we can actually assess (what’s effect of a particularly type of encouragement to vote). A few thoughts on this process:\n\n“Why” questions tend to be more compelling than “What” or “How” or “Do” questions, I think in part because “why” questions often imply a theory and suggest a counterfactual (why this and not that), while other ways of asking questions feel more descriptive. For example, why do the rich vote at higher rates than the poor. Well, one explanation may be that their relative social and economic status means they are more likely to be targets of mobilization efforts by campaigns (among many things). So a natural follow up to this larger question might be, what’s the effect of providing similar mobilization efforts to the poor. Would they vote at similar rates to the rich? If so, then we’ve learned something about how mobilization explains class differences in participation.\nThinking about questions in terms of puzzles is another useful trick. Why do parties exist when politicians’ ideological preferences can explain the vast majority of their legislative behavior? Note this type of question contains a lot of presuppositions (how do we measure ideological preferences? Do they really explain legislative behavior? Is that what we care about?), but as point of departure for a study these type arguments can be useful\nTry to be simple and clear. Don’t worry about asking the perfect question right away. Your questions can and should evolve over time, and I suspect some of you will write a paper that has nothing to do with the questions you posed here.\n\nFor each question, please discuss the following:\n\nWhy do we care? Why we should care about the answer to this question. A strong justification is often that existing theories yield conflicting predictions and so your study will offer some insight into how to adjudicate betweeen these theories. A less strong justification is that no one has ever studied this before. Even if this is true (and it’s often not) it may be true for good reason. No need for formal citations, but if there are specific theories or claims your addressing feel free to name names.\nThe ideal experiment Please describe an “ideal” experiment that you could run that would give you some purchase on your question. Note the key feature of an experiment, is that you the researcher are able to manipulate (through random assignment) some facet of the world. Assume money, resources, physics, and even ethics are not an object. If you could randomly assign anything, what would you manipulate. At what level of analysis would your manipulation occur (i.e. are your units of analysis individuals or countries or something else). How would you measure your outcome, again assuming you were all power and all-seeing. If that manipulation isn’t feasible, what does that say about the ability to make a causal claim about your question?\nThe observational study Finally, considering some of the potential limitations that might prevent you from implementing your ideal experiment (it’s hard to randomly assign democratic government), what is one way you might address your research question with observational data. Would your study use cross-sectional or longitudinal data. What are some of the concerns (selection on observables) that arise in this setting. Is there a natural experiment or some sort of discontinuity you might leverage to approximate this experimental ideal.\n\nAgain, each paragraph should be brief and to the point. No need to specify a full research design–just give me the broad strokes. You’re writing for each question should not exceed a page.\nAfter you’ve thought through how you might go about answering your question, please find\n\nA published study that relates to this question. It need not be exactly your question as posed, but it should be in a similar area. Include a full citation, and link to the study. Then in a paragraph sentences try to summarize:\n\n\nThe study’s research question\nEmprical design\nCore findings.\n\nFinally on a scale of 1 (least feasible) to 10 (most feasible), please evaluate how likely you think it is you could write an empirical paper on this question for this course.\nDon’t worry about getting everything right. Your final projects can, will, and probably should change. The point of this exercise is to get some practice thinking about questions that interest you in the language of causal inference and potential outcomes.",

    "text": "Today we will explore the critiques and alternative explanations for the phenomena of “Red Covid” discussed by the NYT’s David Leonhardt in articles last fall here and more recently here.\nRecall the core thesis of Red Covid is something like the following:\n\nSince Covid-19 vaccines became widely available to the general public in the spring of 2021, Republicans have been less likely to get the vaccine. Lower rates of vaccination among Republicans have in turn led to higher rates of death from Covid-19 in Red States compared to Blue States.\n\nA skeptic of this claim might argue that relationship between electoral and epidemelogical outcomes is spurious, saying somthing like:\n\nThere are lots of ways that Red States differ from Blue States — demographics, economics, geography, culture, and so on – and it is these differences that explain the phenomena of Red Covid. If we were to control for these omitted variables the relationship between a state’s partisan leanings and Covid-19 would go away.\n\nIn this lab, we will see how we can explore these claims using multiple regression to control for competing explanations.\nTo accomplish this we will:\n\nGet set up to work (10 minutes)\n\nThen we will estimate and interpret a series of regression models:\n\nA baseline Red Covid model using simple bivariate regression using the Republican vote share of states to predict the 14-day average of per capita Covid-19 deaths on September 23, 2021 (10 Minutes)\nA multiple regression model controlling for Republican vote share the median age (15 minutes)\nA model controlling for Republican vote share, the median age and median income (15 minutes)\nA model controlling for Republican vote share, the median age median income and vaccination rates (15 minutes)\nA model using Republican vote share, the median age median income to predict vaccination rates (15 minutes)\n\nFinally, we’ll take the weekly survey which will serve as a mid semester check in.\nOne of these 6 tasks (excluding the weekly survey) will be randomly selected as the graded question for the lab.\n\nset.seed(3092022)\ngraded_question &lt;- sample(1:10,size = 1)\npaste(\"Question\",graded_question,\"is the graded question for this week\")\n\n[1] \"Question 6 is the graded question for this week\"\n\n\nYou will work in your assigned groups. Only one member of each group needs to submit the html file of lab.\nThis lab must contain the names of the group members in attendance.\nIf you are attending remotely, you will submit your labs individually.\nHere are your assigned groups for the semester."

A p-value is a conditional probability that arises from a hypothesis test summarizing the likelihood of observing a particular test statistic (here a regression coefficient, or more specifically, a t-statistic which is the regression coefficient divided by its standard error) given a paritcular hypothesis (typically, but not allows a null hypothesis that the true coefficient is 0). In sum, a p-value assess the likelihood of seeing what we did, if in fact, there was no relationship. If that likelihood is small (p&lt;0.05), we reject the claim of no relationship. We remain uncertain about the true value of the coefficient, but we are pretty confident it’s not 0.↩︎\nA standard error is another one of those things that in the cart we’re putting before horse today. Briefly, it is an estimate of the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of a coefficient and describes how much our coefficient might vary had we had a different sample…↩︎"

Lower rates of vaccination among Republicans have in turn led to higher rates of death from Covid-19 in Red States compared to Blue States.\nIn this lab, we’ll reproduce some basic evidence of this phenomena, using bivariate linear regression as a tool to summarize and describe relationships.\nNext week, we’ll see how multiple regression (linear regression with multiple predictors) can be used to assess alternative explanations for the patterns we see.\nTo accomplish this we will:\n\nSet up our work space (2-3 Minutes)\nLoad data on Covid-19 and the 2020 Election. (5 Minutes)\nDescribe the structure of these two datasets (5 Minutes)\nTransform the datasets so we can analyze them (10 minutes)\nMerge the election data into our Covid-19 data (5 minues)\nCalculate the average number new Covid-19 deaths in Red and Blue States (5 minutes)\nCalculate the average number new Covid-19 deaths in Red and B Blue States using linear regression (10 minutes)\nExplore the relationships between Republican vote share, vaccination rates, and deaths from Covid-19 on September 23, 2021 (10 minutes)\nVisualize the relationships between Republican vote share, vaccination rates, and deaths from Covid-19 on September 23, 2021 (15-20 minutes)\nDiscuss some alternative explanations for these relationships (5-10 minutes)\nTake the weekly survey (2-3 minutes)\n\nOne of these 10 tasks (excluding the weekly survey) will be randomly selected as the graded question for the lab.\nYou will work in your assigned groups. Only one member of each group needs to submit the html file of lab.\nThis lab must contain the names of the group members in attendance.\nIf you are attending remotely, you will submit your labs individually.\nHere are your assigned groups for the semester."

It was in the field from February 28 to March 2.\nFirst, we will explore how support for the war varies with the demographic predictors age, sex and education. We will compare the results of modeling this relationship using Ordinary Least Squares regression and Logisitic Regression\nWe’ll talk more about the technical aspects of logistic regression next week. For today we’ll simply compare the results from these two approaches.\nNext, we will gain insight into how our estimates from these models might vary using the statistical process of bootstrapping. Specifically, we will simulate the idea of repeated sampling that is the foundation of frequentist interpretations of probability, by sampling from our sample with replacement.\nWe’ll walk through the mechanics of simulation together. Then you’ll quantify the uncertainty described by these bootstrapped sampling distributions.\nFinally, we’ll see what other questions we might ask of these data and practice various skills we’ve developed through out the course.\nPlan to spend the following amount of time on each section\n\nGet set up to work (5 minutes)\nModel the relationship between demographic predictors and war support using OLS and Logistic regression (20 minutes)\nAssess the uncertainty around your estimated coefficients (15 minutes)\nQuantify the uncertainy described by your sampling distributions (10 minutes)\nExplore other relationships in the data.

The differences aren’t huge – a few percentage points – but for a binary outcome we will often prefer to model it with logistic regression.\nAlso note that marginal effect for age in the logistic regression is not constant.

Efron (1979) called this procedure “bootstrapping” after the idiom “to pull oneself up by one’s own bootstraps”\nWe do this by sampling from our sample with replacement.\nWhen we sample with replacement, we are sampling from our sample, as our sample was sampled from the population.\nWith replacement means that some observations will appear multiple times in our bootstrapped sample (while others will not be included at all).\nWhen an observation appears multiple times in a bootstrap sample, conceptually, we’re using that original observation to represent the other people like that observation in the population who – had we taken a different sample – might have been included in our data.\nNote each bootstrap sample is a different random sample with replacement. In our second bootstrap sample, one observation (person 1496) appeared five times.\n\ntable(table(boot$strap[[2]]$idx))\n\n\n  1   2   3   4   5   6 \n661 342 105  31   1   3 \n\n# Person 406\nsum(boot$strap[[2]]$idx == 1496)\n\n[1] 5\n\n# Person 1 is not in boostrap 2\nsum(boot$strap[[2]]$idx == 1)\n\n[1] 0"

    "text": "8.1 Measures of Central Tendency\nMeasures of central tendency describe what a typical value of some variable. In this course, we’ll use three measures of what’s typical:\n\nmean\nmedian\nmode\n\n\n8.1.1 Mean\nOne of the most frequent measures of central tendency we’ll use in this course is a mean or average.\nSuppose we have \\(n\\) observations of some variable \\(x\\). We can calculate the mean of \\(\\bar{x}\\) (“x bar), by adding up all the values of x\n[ {x}=_{i=1}^n x_i ]\nWe’ll see later in the course that means are closely related to the concept of expected values in probability and that conditional means (which we’ll calculate below) are central to thinking about linear regression.\nFor now, please calculate the mean (average) number of new cases per 100,000 residents in our data:\nLast class, when we calculated the the average number of new cases under each type of face mask policy, we were calculating a conditional mean the mean of some variable, conditional on some other variable taking a specific value.\nFormally, you’ll often see this written in terms of Expected Values: Something like\n[ E[Y|X=x] ]\nOr to make it more concrete:\n[ E[ | ] ]\nIn code, we could accomplish this manually, using the index operator:\n\n# mean(covid_us$new_cases_pc[covid_us$face_masks == \"No policy\"], na.rm=T)\n\n\n8.1.1.1 How would we calculate the conditional mean of new_cases_pc when face_masks equals “Recommended”\nBy using group_by() with summarise() we can accomplish this more quickly:\n\n# covid_us%&gt;%\n#   group_by(face_masks)%&gt;%\n#   summarise(\n#     new_cases_pc = mean(new_cases_pc, na.rm=T)\n#   )\n\n\n\n\n8.1.2 Median\nThe median is another measure of what’s typical for variables that take numeric values\nImagine, we took our data new Covid-19 cases and arranged them in ascending order, from the smallest value to highest value\nThe median would be the value in the exact middle of that sequence, also known as the 50th percentile.1\nFormally, we can define that median as:\n[ M_x = X_i : ^{x_i} f_x(X)dx=^f_x(X)dx=1/2 ]\nWhich might look like Greek to you, which is fine. Just think of it as the middle value.\n\n8.1.2.1 Please calculate the median number of new Covid-19 cases per 100,000 using the median() function. How does it compare to the mean?\n\n\nMedians are less influenced by outliers than means\n\n\n\n\n\n8.1.3 Modes\nConceptually, a mode describes the most frequent outcome.\nModes are useful for describing what’s typical of “nominal” or categorical data like our measure of face mask policy.\nTo calculate the mode of our face_masks variable, wrap the output of table() with the sort() function\n\n# sort(table(covid_us$face_masks))\n\nFor numeric data, modes correspond to the peak of a variable’s density function (more on this later in the class).\nYou can get a sense of the relationship between, means, median’s and modes from this helpful figure from Wikipedia:\n\nknitr::include_graphics(\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Visualisation_mode_median_mean.svg/240px-Visualisation_mode_median_mean.svg.png\")"

    "text": "8.2 Measures of Dispersion\nMeasures of dispersion describe how much the data “vary.” Let’s discuss the following ways we can summarize how our data vary:\n\nrange\npercentile range\nvariance\nstandard deviation\n\n\n8.2.1 Range\nThe range of a variable is simply it’s minimum and maximum value\n\n8.2.1.1 Please calculate the range of our new_cases_pc using the range() function\n\n\n8.2.1.2 What states on what dates observed these minimum and maximum values?\n\n\n\n8.2.2 Percentiles Ranges\nThe \\(p\\)-th percentile is the value of the observation such that 100*p percent of the data are to the left and 100-100*p are two the right.\n[ p_x = X_i : ^{x_i} f_x(X)dx= p; ^f_x(X)dx=1-p ]\nThe median is just the 50th percentile\nIn R we calculate the \\(p\\)-th percentile using the quantile() setting the probs argument to the \\(p/100\\) percentile that we we want.\n\n8.2.2.1 Please use the quantile() function to calculate the 25th and 75th percentiles of the new_cases_pc variable.\nThe 25th and 75th percentile define the “Interquartile Range” where 50 percent of the observations lie within this range, and 50 percent lie outside the range.\n\n\n\n8.2.3 Variance\nVariance describes how much observations of a given measure vary around that measure’s mean.\nThe variance in a given sample is calculated by taking the average of the sum of squared deviations (i.e. differences) around a measure’s mean.\n[ ^2_x=_{i=1}n(x_i-{x})2 ]\n\n\\(x_i-\\bar{x}\\) is the deviation of each observation from the overall mean\n\\((x_i-\\bar{x})^2}\\) squaring this ensures that we treat positive and negative deviations the same when calculating the overall variance\n\\(\\sum_{i=1}\\) sums up all the differences\n\\(\\frac{1}{n-1}\\) is like taking the average of these differences (we divide by \\(n-1\\) instead of \\(n\\) for statistical reasons that we’ll return two when we talk about estimation)\n\n\n8.2.3.1 Use the var() function to calculate the variance of the new_cases_pc variable.\nVariance will be important for thinking about uncertainty and inference (e.g. how might our estimate have been different)\n\n\n\n8.2.4 Standard Deviations\nA standard deviation is simply the square root of variable’s variance.\n[ _x== ]\nStandard deviations are easier to interpet because their units are the same as variable.\nThink of them as a measure of the typical amount of variation for variable.\n\n8.2.4.1 let’s use the sd() function to calculate the standard deviation of the new_cases_pc variable"

    "text": "8.3 Measures of Association\nMeasures of association describe how variables relate to each other.\n\n8.3.1 Covariance\nCovariance describes how two variables “co-vary”.\nWhen \\(x\\) is above its mean, \\(y\\) also tends to be above it’s mean, these variables have a positive covariance.\nIf when \\(x\\) tends to be high, \\(y\\) tends to be low, these variables have a negative variance\nFormally, the sample2 covariance of two variables can written as follows:\n[ cov(x,y)=_{i=1}^n(x_i-{x})(y_i-{y}) ]\n\n8.3.1.1 Please calculate the covariance between the percent of state’s population that is fully vaccinated (percent_vaccinated) and new_cases_pc using the var() function\n\n\n\n8.3.2 Correlation\nLike variances, covariances don’t really have intrinsic meaning, since x and y can be measured on very different scales.\nThe correlation between two variables takes their covariance and scales this by the standard deviation of each variable, creating a measure that can range from -1 (perfect negative correlation) to 1 perfect positive correlation.\nAgain, we can write this formally\n[ _{x,y} = ]\nBut don’t sweat the formulas too much. I’m just contractually obligated to show you math.\n\n8.3.2.1 Calculate the correlation between the percent of state’s population that is fully vaccinated (percent_vaccinated) and new_cases_pc using the cor() function.\nYou’ll need to set the argument use=\"complete.obs\nHmm… That seems a little strange. What if we calculated the correlation between vaccination rates and new cases separately for each month in 2021\n\n\n8.3.2.2 Uncomment and interpret the output of the code below\n\n# covid_us %&gt;%\n#   filter(year &gt; 2020)%&gt;%\n#   ungroup() %&gt;%\n#   group_by(year,month)%&gt;%\n#   summarise(\n#     mn_per_vax = mean(percent_vaccinated, na.rm=T),\n#     cor = cor(new_cases_pc, percent_vaccinated, use = \"complete.obs\")\n#   )"

Lots of things are changing and these month comparisons are by no means perfect. Lot’s of things differ between states with different mask policies. What we’d really like to know is a sort of counterfactual comparison between the number new cases in a state with a given policy and what those new cases would have been had that state had a different policy.\nThe problem is, we don’t get to see that counterfactual outcome. So how can we make causal claims about the effects of facemasks, or any other policy that interests us? Finding creative ways to answer these questions is the key to making credible causal claims.\nNext week, we’ll explore how to make this figure and many more from our data"

    "text": "3.1 Describe your expectations for these models\nBefore you estimate these models, please answer the following:\nIn the baseline model, m1 what do you expect the sign of the coefficient for each predictor to be:\n\nAge (Positive/Negative)\nSex (Positive/Negative)4\nEducation (Positive/Negative)\n\nIn the interaction model, m2\n\nDo you think the relationship between age and support will vary by sex (Yes/No)\nIf you said yes, do you think the coefficient on the interaction between age and sex will be positive or negative (Positive/Negative)\n\nIn the polynomial model, m3\n\nIf the coefficient on age is positive and the coefficient on age^2 is positive, then as age increases, the increase in the predicted level of support will be (increasing/decreasing)\nIf the coefficient on age is positive and the coefficient on age^2 is negative, then as age increases, the increase in the predicted level of support will be (increasing/decreasing)\n\nIn m4\n\nIf the coefficients on the interaction terms between the sex variable and the age variables (age and age^2) is statistically significant, this implies that the relationship between age and support for the war is (similar/different) for male and female respondents.\n\nIn the baseline model, m1 what do you expect the sign of the coefficient for each predictor to be:\n\nAge I’d expect the coefficient to be Positive reflecting my weak prior belief that young people tend to be less supportive of war than old people (maybe because they’re more likely to be the ones fighting and dying in the war.)\nSex The coefficient on the sex variable describes the difference between male and female respondents (controlling for age and education). Because sex is a character string, R converts it into a binary indicator, sexMale, which takes a value of 1 when respodents are Male and 0 otherwise (when respondents are Female). R chose Female as the reference category because the letter F comes before M alphabetically. The coefficient on sexMale tells us how Male respondents differ from Female respondents. Again I don’t have strong prior beliefs, but my hunch is that men tend to be more supportive of War than women for some complex set of reasons that reflect mixture of Nature vs Nurture type explanations.\nEducation I’d expect the coefficient on education to be negative, because education, in the U.S. context tends to be correlated with more liberal or progressive policy views which tend to be more Doveish on matters of foreign policy.\n\nHonestly though, you could probably make the case for opposite sign on each of these coefficients.\n\nMaybe age is associated with less support, because older people lived through Russia’s wars in Afghanistan\nMaybe Men are more likely to be opposed to war because they are more likely to fight in it.\nMaybe the educated in Russia are more likely to support the war because they are more likely to be part of the ruling elite/consume more media (and state media)/less likely to have to fight, etc.\n\nThe real point of this question is to give you practice thinking about how to test the empirical implications of your theoretical expectations with regression.\nIn the interaction model, m2\n\nDo you think the relationship between age and support will vary by sex? No. But then I’ve already seen the data.\nIf you said yes, do you think the coefficient on the interaction between age and sex will be positive or negative? This question required you to know what the term R would choose to represent sex. In m2 the coefficient on age describes the relationship between age and support for female respondents. The coeficient on age:sexMale describes how this slope/relationship changes for men.\n\nIf the relationship for age is **positive for female respondents, and the coefficient on the interaction term is negative, this implies that support for the war increases more slowly with age for male respondents compared to female respondents.\nSimilarly, if the coefficient on the interaction term was positive, this implies that support for war increases more rapidly with age for men compared to women.\nIn the polynomial model, m3\n\nIf the coefficient on age is positive and the coefficient on age^2 is positive, then as age increases, the increase in the predicted level of support will be increasing (Think of \\(\\cup\\)-shaped parabola )\nIf the coefficient on age is positive and the coefficient on age^2 is negative, then as age increases, the increase in the predicted level of support will be decreasing (Think of \\(\\cap\\)-shaped parabola )\n\nIn m4\n\nIf the coefficients on the interaction terms between the sex variable and the age variables (age and age^2) is statistically significant, this implies that the relationship between age and support for the war is different for male and female respondents.\n\nIn general, interaction terms allow relationships to vary accross groups or values of predictors.\nIf both m2 and m3 had yielded statistically signficiant results, maybe m4 would have been justified, but honestly I had you fit m4 primarily for pedagogical reasons so you could see that even very complciated models can be understood using predicted values."

When the variable facial_coverings equals 0, R will input the character string \"No policy\" into the face_masks variable.\nWhen the absolute value of facial_coverings equals 1 (i.e.facial_coverings equals 1 or -1 ), R will input the character string \"Recommended\" into the face_masks variable.

Lower rates of vaccination among Republicans have in turn led to higher rates of death from Covid-19 in Red States compared to Blue States.\nIn this lab, we’ll reproduce some basic evidence of this phenomena, using bivariate linear regression as a tool to summarize and describe relationships.\nNext week, we’ll see how multiple regression (linear regression with multiple predictors) can be used to assess alternative explanations for the patterns we see.\nTo accomplish this we will:\n\nSet up our work space (2-3 Minutes)\nLoad data on Covid-19 and the 2020 Election.

This difference reflects the fact that Biden tended to win more populous states than trump, so simply looking at the average number of new deaths is bit misleading. Comparing 7-day averages per 100,000 residents adjusts for differences in population between Red and Blue States.\nWhen we limit our analysis, to just observations before April 19, 2021, the difference in the 7-day average rate of new Covid-19 deaths per 100,000 residents is relatively small (0.02 more deaths per 100,000 residents in Red States)\nWhen we look at observations after the vaccine became widely available the difference is more than 6 times as big (0.125 more deaths per 100,000 residents in Red States)"

Things like for() loops, functions() and apply() can reduce the amount of copying, pasting and replacing you have to do, which in turn can reduce the amount of errors induced by forgetting to change a variable name, or mistyping a command.\nBut the first time you see a for loop, or define your own function, it will likely seem a bit abstract, and obtuse.That’s ok. The goal is that you have a better, if not perfect, understanding of these concepts which we will use throughout the course."

In this course, we’ll use three measures of what’s typical:\n\nmean\nmedian\nmode\n\n\n8.1.1 Mean\nOne of the most frequent measures of central tendency we’ll use in this course is a mean or average.\nSuppose we have \\(n\\) observations of some variable \\(x\\). We can calculate the mean of \\(\\bar{x}\\) (“x bar), by adding up all the values of x\n[ {x}=_{i=1}^n x_i ]\nWe’ll see later in the course that means are closely related to the concept of expected values in probability and that conditional means (which we’ll calculate below) are central to thinking about linear regression.\nFor now, please calculate the mean (average) number of new cases per 100,000 residents in our data:\n\nmean(covid_us$new_cases_pc, na.rm=T)\n\n[1] 28.11486\n\n\nLast class, when we calculated the the average number of new cases under each type of face mask policy, we were calculating a conditional mean the mean of some variable, conditional on some other variable taking a specific value.\nFormally, you’ll often see this written in terms of Expected Values: Something like\n[ E[Y|X=x] ]\nOr to make it more concrete:\n[ E[ | ] ]\nIn code, we could accomplish this manually, using the index operator:\n\nmean(covid_us$new_cases_pc[covid_us$face_masks == \"No policy\"], na.rm=T)\n\n[1] 10.26168\n\n\n\n8.1.1.1 How would we calculate the conditional mean of new_cases_pc when face_masks equals “Recommend”\n\nmean(covid_us$new_cases_pc[covid_us$face_masks == \"Recommended\"], na.rm=T)\n\n[1] 16.61408\n\n\nBy using group_by() with summarise() we can accomplish this more quickly:\n\ncovid_us%&gt;%\n  group_by(face_masks)%&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    new_cases_pc = mean(new_cases_pc, na.rm=T)\n  )\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 2\n  face_masks             new_cases_pc\n  &lt;fct&gt;                         &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 No policy                      10.3\n2 Recommended                    16.6\n3 Some requirements              36.2\n4 Required shared places         29.4\n5 Required all times             32.2\n6 &lt;NA&gt;                           11.8\n\n\n\n\n\n8.1.2 Median\nThe median is another measure of what’s typical for variables that take numeric values\nImagine, we took our data new Covid-19 cases and arranged them in ascending order, from the smallest value to highest value\nThe median would be the value in the exact middle of that sequence, also known as the 50th percentile.1\nFormally, we can define that median as:\n[ M_x = X_i : ^{x_i} f_x(X)dx=^f_x(X)dx=1/2 ]\nWhich might look like Greek to you, which is fine. Just think of it as the middle value.\n\n8.1.2.1 Please calculate the median number of new Covid-19 cases per 100,000 using the median() function. How does it compare to the mean?\n\nmedian(covid_us$new_cases_pc, na.rm=T)\n\n[1] 10.52355\n\n\nInteresting the median is much lower than the mean. If we were to look at a histogram of our data (more on that next week; think of it as a graphical representation of a frequency table), we see that the new_cases_pc has a “long tail” or is skewed to the right. Most of the values are close to 0, but there are few cases that are extreme outliers.\n\n\nMedians are less influenced by outliers than means\n\n\n\nhist(covid_us$new_cases_pc, breaks = 100)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.1.3 Modes\nConceptually, a mode describes the most frequent outcome.\nModes are useful for describing what’s typical of “nominal” or categorical data like our measure of face mask policy.\nTo calculate the mode of our face_masks variable, wrap the output of table() with the sort() function\n\nsort(table(covid_us$face_masks))\n\n\n    Required all times              No policy            Recommended \n                  1032                   3893                   8879 \nRequired shared places      Some requirements \n                 15088                  24786 \n\n\nFor numeric data, modes correspond to the peak of a variable’s density function (more on this later in the class).\nYou can get a sense of the relationship between, means, median’s and modes from this helpful figure from Wikipedia:\n\nknitr::include_graphics(\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Visualisation_mode_median_mean.svg/240px-Visualisation_mode_median_mean.svg.png\")"

Lots of things are changing and these month comparisons are by no means perfect. Lot’s of things differ between states with different mask policies. What we’d really like to know is a sort of counterfactual comparison between the number new cases in a state with a given policy and what those new cases would have been had that state had a different policy.\nThe problem is, we don’t get to see that counterfactual outcome. So how can we make causal claims about the effects of facemasks, or any other policy that interests us? Finding creative ways to answer these questions is the key to making credible causal claims.\nNext week, we’ll explore how to make this figure and many more from our data"

It was in the field from February 28 to March 2.\nFirst, we will explore how support for the war varies with the demographic predictors age, sex and education. We will compare the results of modeling this relationship using Ordinary Least Squares regression and Logisitic Regression\nWe’ll talk more about the technical aspects of logistic regression next week. For today we’ll simply compare the results from these two approaches.\nNext, we will gain insight into how our estimates from these models might vary using the statistical process of bootstrapping. Specifically, we will simulate the idea of repeated sampling that is the foundation of frequentist interpretations of probability, by sampling from our sample with replacement.\nWe’ll walk through the mechanics of simulation together. Then you’ll quantify the uncertainty described by these bootstrapped sampling distributions.\nFinally, we’ll see what other questions we might ask of these data and practice various skills we’ve developed through out the course.\nPlan to spend the following amount of time on each section\n\nGet set up to work (5 minutes)\nModel the relationship between demographic predictors and war support using OLS and Logistic regression (20 minutes)\nAssess the uncertainty around your estimated coefficients (15 minutes)\nQuantify the uncertainty described by your sampling distributions (10 minutes)\nExplore other relationships in the data.

    "text": "Today we will explore the critiques and alternative explanations for the phenomena of “Red Covid” discussed by the NYT’s David Leonhardt in articles last fall here and more recently here.\nRecall the core thesis of Red Covid is something like the following:\n\nSince Covid-19 vaccines became widely available to the general public in the spring of 2021, Republicans have been less likely to get the vaccine. Lower rates of vaccination among Republicans have in turn led to higher rates of death from Covid-19 in Red States compared to Blue States.\n\nA skeptic of this claim might argue that relationship between electoral and epidemelogical outcomes is spurious. There are lots of ways that Red States differ from Blue States — demographics, economics, geography, culture, and so on – and it is these differences that explain the phenomena of Red Covid. If we were to control for these omitted variables the relationship between a state’s partisan leanings and Covid-19 would go away.\nIn this lab, we will see how we can explore these claims using multiple regression to control for competing explanations.\nTo accomplish this we will:\n\nGet set up to work (10 minutes)\n\nThen we will estimate and interpret a series of regression models:\n\nA baseline Red Covid model using simple bivariate regression using the Republican vote share of states to predict the 14-day average of per capita Covid-19 deaths on September 23, 2021 (10 Minutes)\nA multiple regression model controlling for Republican vote share the median age (15 minutes)\nA model controlling for Republican vote share, the median age and median income (15 minutes)\nA model controlling for Republican vote share, the median age median income and vaccination rates (15 minutes)\nA model using Republican vote share, the median age median income to predict vaccination rates (15 minutes)\n\nFinally, we’ll take the weekly survey which will serve as a mid semester check in.\nOne of these 6 tasks (excluding the weekly survey) will be randomly selected as the graded question for the lab.\n\nset.seed(3092022)\ngraded_question &lt;- sample(1:10,size = 1)\npaste(\"Question\",graded_question,\"is the graded question for this week\")\n\n[1] \"Question 6 is the graded question for this week\"\n\n\nYou will work in your assigned groups. Only one member of each group needs to submit the html file of lab.\nThis lab must contain the names of the group members in attendance.\nIf you are attending remotely, you will submit your labs individually.\nHere are your assigned groups for the semester."

    "text": "6.4 Interpret the results\nSummarize the results of m5 and offer some broader discussion of what we’ve learned today\nIn m5 all three predictors have strong statistically significant relationships with vaccination rates in the expected direction. States where more people voted for Trump in 2020 tend to have lower rates of vaccination. States with an older population, and a richer population tend to have higher rates of vaccination.\nThinking back to the previous models we’ve estimated, we might argue that the effects these predictors have on Covid-19 death rates is mediated through their relationship with vaccination rates.\nMore broadly, what does this analysis mean for arguments about Red Covid. I guess, I’d say it’s complicated. Vaccines are clearly effective at reducing Covid-19 deaths. In both aggregate and invidual level data, Republicans appear to be less willing to get vaccinated. But lots of other factors influence vaccination rates and public health more broadly.\nRegression is a tool for trying to explore these competing explanations, but without strong theory and clever design, it’s unlikely to resolve debates. There’s almost always a skeptic waiting to say “Yes, but have you controlled for …” We can try to address there concerns by controlling for more and more variables. But a better strategy is often to say, I don’t need to control for X because the logic of my design already accounts for X.\nStill it’s hard to think what that kind of design would be for something like for debates about Red Covid. Maybe we need different (individual data) or maybe we’d want to reframe the question or draw out further testable implications of the claim. If your group is looking for a final project, there are number of directions you could take this kind of analysis:\n\nLooking at different periods overtime\nLooking at smaller units of aggregation (counties)\nControlling for alternative factors\nLeveraging variation in the availability of vaccines over time and place."

In sum, a p-value assess the likelihood of seeing what we did, if in fact, there was no relationship. If that likelihood is small (p&lt;0.05), we reject the claim of no relationship.

Perhaps we could construct another variable that distinguished state-level policies from more localized policies, or we could only look at cases where there was a uniform state policy."

    "text": "8.1 Measures of Central Tendency\nMeasures of central tendency describe what a typical value of some variable. In this course, we’ll use three measures of what’s typical:\n\nmean\nmedian\nmode\n\n\n8.1.1 Mean\nOne of the most frequent measures of central tendency we’ll use in this course is a mean or average.\nSuppose we have \\(n\\) observations of some variable \\(x\\). We can calculate the mean of \\(\\bar{x}\\) (“x bar), by adding up all the values of x\n[ {x}=_{i=1}^n x_i ]\nWe’ll see later in the course that means are closely related to the concept of expected values in probability and that conditional means (which we’ll calculate below) are central to thinking about linear regression.\nFor now, please calculate the mean (average) number of new cases per 100,000 residents in our data:\n\nmean(covid_us$new_cases_pc, na.rm=T)\n\n[1] 28.11486\n\n\nLast class, when we calculated the the average number of new cases under each type of face mask policy, we were calculating a conditional mean the mean of some variable, conditional on some other variable taking a specific value.\nFormally, you’ll often see this written in terms of Expected Values: Something like\n[ E[Y|X=x] ]\nOr to make it more concrete:\n[ E[ | ] ]\nIn code, we could accomplish this manually, using the index operator:\n\nmean(covid_us$new_cases_pc[covid_us$face_masks == \"No policy\"], na.rm=T)\n\n[1] 10.26168\n\n\n\n8.1.1.1 How would we calculate the conditional mean of new_cases_pc when face_masks equals “Recommend”\n\nmean(covid_us$new_cases_pc[covid_us$face_masks == \"Recommended\"], na.rm=T)\n\n[1] 16.61408\n\n\nBy using group_by() with summarise() we can accomplish this more quickly:\n\ncovid_us%&gt;%\n  group_by(face_masks)%&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    new_cases_pc = mean(new_cases_pc, na.rm=T)\n  )\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 2\n  face_masks             new_cases_pc\n  &lt;fct&gt;                         &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 No policy                      10.3\n2 Recommended                    16.6\n3 Some requirements              36.2\n4 Required shared places         29.4\n5 Required all times             32.2\n6 &lt;NA&gt;                           11.8\n\n\n\n\n\n8.1.2 Median\nThe median is another measure of what’s typical for variables that take numeric values\nImagine, we took our data new Covid-19 cases and arranged them in ascending order, from the smallest value to highest value\nThe median would be the value in the exact middle of that sequence, also known as the 50th percentile.1\nFormally, we can define that median as:\n[ M_x = X_i : ^{x_i} f_x(X)dx=^f_x(X)dx=1/2 ]\nWhich might look like Greek to you, which is fine. Just think of it as the middle value.\n\n8.1.2.1 Please calculate the median number of new Covid-19 cases per 100,000 using the median() function. How does it compare to the mean?\n\nmedian(covid_us$new_cases_pc, na.rm=T)\n\n[1] 10.52355\n\n\nInteresting the median is much lower than the mean. If we were to look at a histogram of our data (more on that next week; think of it as a graphical representation of a frequency table), we see that the new_cases_pc has a “long tail” or is skewed to the right. Most of the values are close to 0, but there are few cases that are extreme outliers.\n\n\nMedians are less influenced by outliers than means\n\n\n\nhist(covid_us$new_cases_pc, breaks = 100)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.1.3 Modes\nConceptually, a mode describes the most frequent outcome.\nModes are useful for describing what’s typical of “nominal” or categorical data like our measure of face mask policy.\nTo calculate the mode of our face_masks variable, wrap the output of table() with the sort() function\n\nsort(table(covid_us$face_masks))\n\n\n    Required all times              No policy            Recommended \n                  1032                   3893                   8879 \nRequired shared places      Some requirements \n                 15088                  24786 \n\n\nFor numeric data, modes correspond to the peak of a variable’s density function (more on this later in the class).\nYou can get a sense of the relationship between, means, median’s and modes from this helpful figure from Wikipedia:\n\nknitr::include_graphics(\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Visualisation_mode_median_mean.svg/240px-Visualisation_mode_median_mean.svg.png\")"

Lots of things are changing and these month comparisons are by no means perfect. Lot’s of things differ between states with different mask policies. What we’d really like to know is a sort of counterfactual comparison between the number new cases in a state with a given policy and what those new cases would have been had that state had a different policy.\nThe problem is, we don’t get to see that counterfactual outcome. So how can we make causal claims about the effects of facemasks, or any other policy that interests us? Finding creative ways to answer these questions is the key to making credible causal claims.\nNext week, we’ll explore how to make this figure and many more from our data"

    "text": "Footnotes\n\n\nMathematically, recall that the slope/first derivative of the line \\(y = f(x) = 2x\\) is constant \\((f'(x) = 2)\\). If we increase x by 1, we expect y to increase by 2, while the derivative of a parabola \\(y = f(z) = z^2\\) varies with \\(z\\) \\((f'(z) = 2x)\\). Going from z= 2 to z= 3 is associated with a greater increase in y, then going from z=1 to z=2. Our model, however, is still linear in parameters \\(\\beta\\). That is, it is still a linear regression. If our model included some parameter \\(\\theta^2\\), then it would be a non-linear regression.↩︎\nIn a machine learning framework, we trying to find an optimal tradeoff between reducing bias in our predictors by including more predictors and minimizing variance in predictions by not overfitting the data.↩︎\nI think, google translate was a bit unclear. But higher numbers equal more education.↩︎\nThis is tricky, you need to know what the reference (excluded) category will be.↩︎\nBasically, I’m asking whether the coefficient on I(age^2) is statistically significant. If it is, then the change in predicted support for the war among say 20-year-olds compared to 30-year-olds, would be different than change between 30- to 40-year-olds. Interpreting polynomials terms and interaction models is much easier if, as we do later, we simply obtain and plot the predicted values from this model↩︎\nAs in the previous question, basically you need to look at the table and see if the coefficients on the interaction terms are statistically significant. It’s a little more complicated than this, but if they are significant, this is evidence of differences across Sex.↩︎"

    "text": "Asking a good research question is one of the most important skills you will develop in your academic careers. It’s also one of the hardest.\nWe often think we’re asking one question, when in fact the study we conduct really addresses a related but distinct question. When a priest asked Willie Sutton why he robbed banks, he replied the “Well, that’s where the money is”. The priest’s question was about why rob at all, while Sutton answered the different question “Given one robs, why rob banks?” Similarly, Medieval philosophers might ask why objects stay in motion, while Newton suggests what really need is not an explanation of motion itself but of changes in motion.\nThe object of our question shapes the form of our explanation.\nIn this assignment, I would like your group to craft three potential research questions that we might explore in our research project for this class. Each question, should be a single sentence, with a few sentences answering the following questions (More details below):\n\nWhy do we care about the answer to this research question?\nWhat’s would a hypothetical “ideal experiment” to answer this question look like?\nWhat would a study with observational data look like?\nA published study that relates to this question\nHow feasible would it be to do a study like this for the course\n\nYou may use this Rmd file as a template (click here to download) or create your own file. Please submit your responses to Canvas.\nYou might start by writing down several questions of different forms about the same topic:\n\nWhy do people vote?\nWhy do people not vote?\nWhy do the rich vote at higher rates than the poor?\nWhen might people who don’t vote, be motivated to vote?\nWhat is the effect of encouraging someone to vote via a phone call?\nAre phone calls more or less effective than in-person contact for get-out the vote efforts?\n\nEach of these questions addresses a general topic that political scientists seem to think is important. Each carries some suppositions and assumptions that in turn influence the type of explanation we might find convincing. Why do people vote feels a bit broad to me. People probably vote for many reasons. How can we hope to adjudicate between all the possible reasons for voting? (Further are these the same reasons for not voting or do we need another set of explanations altogether?)\nWhether phone calls are more or less effective than in-person contacts for GOTV efforts seems more tractable, but also perhaps to narrow. Do we really care? If we’re confident we can identify an effect or difference in one study, are we sure we’ll see similar effects in a different study conducted under different circumstances?\nIn crafting your research questions, you want to strike a balance between things we actually care about (why do people vote) and things we can actually assess (what’s effect of a particularly type of encouragement to vote). A few thoughts on this process:\n\n“Why” questions tend to be more compelling than “What” or “How” or “Do” questions, I think in part because “why” questions often imply a theory and suggest a counterfactual (why this and not that), while other ways of asking questions feel more descriptive. For example, why do the rich vote at higher rates than the poor. Well, one explanation may be that their relative social and economic status means they are more likely to be targets of mobilization efforts by campaigns (among many things). So a natural follow up to this larger question might be, what’s the effect of providing similar mobilization efforts to the poor. Would they vote at similar rates to the rich? If so, then we’ve learned something about how mobilization explains class differences in participation.\nThinking about questions in terms of puzzles is another useful trick. Why do parties exist when politicians’ ideological preferences can explain the vast majority of their legislative behavior? Note this type of question contains a lot of presuppositions (how do we measure ideological preferences? Do they really explain legislative behavior? Is that what we care about?), but as point of departure for a study these type arguments can be useful\nTry to be simple and clear. Don’t worry about asking the perfect question right away. Your questions can and should evolve over time, and I suspect some of you will write a paper that has nothing to do with the questions you posed here.\n\nFor each question, please discuss the following:\n\nWhy do we care? Why we should care about the answer to this question. A strong justification is often that existing theories yield conflicting predictions and so your study will offer some insight into how to adjudicate betweeen these theories. A less strong justification is that no one has ever studied this before. Even if this is true (and it’s often not) it may be true for good reason. No need for formal citations, but if there are specific theories or claims your addressing feel free to name names.\nThe ideal experiment Please describe an “ideal” experiment that you could run that would give you some purchase on your question. Note the key feature of an experiment, is that you the researcher are able to manipulate (through random assignment) some facet of the world. Assume money, resources, physics, and even ethics are not an object. If you could randomly assign anything, what would you manipulate. At what level of analysis would your manipulation occur (i.e. are your units of analysis individuals or countries or something else). How would you measure your outcome, again assuming you were all power and all-seeing. If that manipulation isn’t feasible, what does that say about the ability to make a causal claim about your question?\nThe observational study Finally, considering some of the potential limitations that might prevent you from implementing your ideal experiment (it’s hard to randomly assign democratic government), what is one way you might address your research question with observational data. Would your study use cross-sectional or longitudinal data. What are some of the concerns (selection on observables) that arise in this setting. Is there a natural experiment or some sort of discontinuity you might leverage to approximate this experimental ideal.\n\nAgain, each paragraph should be brief and to the point. No need to specify a full research design–just give me the broad strokes. You’re writing for each question should not exceed a page.\nAfter you’ve thought through how you might go about answering your question, please find\n\nA published study that relates to this question. It need not be exactly your question as posed, but it should be in a similar area. Include a full citation, and link to the study. Then in a paragraph sentences try to summarize:\n\n\nThe study’s research question\nEmprical design\nCore findings.\n\nFinally on a scale of 1 (least feasible) to 10 (most feasible), please evaluate how likely you think it is you could write an empirical paper on this question for this course.\nDon’t worry about getting everything right. Your final projects can, will, and probably should change. The point of this exercise is to get some practice thinking about questions that interest you in the language of causal inference and potential outcomes."

    "text": "Do you need to know the math?\n\n\n\n- Yes!\n\n\n- Math is a precise and concise way to describe what we’re doing - A whole range of studies can be described by the same design (experiment, Diff-in-Diff, regression, etc) represented with the same formula - If you want to prove some property of some formula (e.g. show that under the Gauss-Markov assumptions linear regression is BLUE), you will do this with Math.\n\n\n## Do you need to know the math?\n\n\n- No!\n\n\n- Computers love math. Humans not so much. - We can understand and demonstrate a lot of methods and theories through programming - It’s easier to simulate the Central Limit Theorem than it is to prove it. - But the reasons the simulations “work” is because of the underlying math\n\n\n## Do you need to know the math?\n\n\n- Maybe!\n\n\n- I assume very little background math - I show you some mathematical concepts because: - For some people it’s helpful - You’ll encounter these symbols and formulas elsewhere - Even if you don’t understand/remember the chain rule you can hopefully understand at a conceptual level what’s going on when we minimize the SSR - If you want to go to grad school, you’ll have to do the math - If you want to do research, you’ll have understand the implications of the math\n\n\n## Do you need to know how to program?\n\n\n- Yes.\n\n\n- It’s unavoidable, if you want to do applied, empirical work\n\n\n- It lets us avoid having to walk through formal proofs\n\n\n- It’s incredibly marketable.\n\n\nclass:inverse, middle, center # 🔍 ## Review: Regression\n\n\n## What you need to know about Regression: Conceptual - Simple linear regression estimates a line of best fit that summarizes relationships between two variables\n\n\n\\[y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_i + \\epsilon_i \\]\n\n\n- Multiple regression generalizes this approach to include multiple predictors\n\n\n\\[y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_1 +  \\beta_2 x_2 + \\dots + \\beta_j x_j + \\epsilon_i \\] \\[y_i = X\\beta + \\epsilon_i \\] - The coefficients in regression models tell us how the outcome \\(y\\) is expected to change as some predictor, \\(x\\) changes.\n\n\n## What you need to know about Regression: Practical\n\n\n- We estimate regressions using the lm() function\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=“center”}\n\n\n{.r .cell-code} m1 &lt;- lm(y ~ x, data = df) :::\n\n\n- We control for additional variables by adding them to the formula\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=“center”}\n\n\n{.r .cell-code} m2 &lt;- lm(y ~ x + z, data = df) :::\n\n\n- We can interact variables using the * operator.

    "section": "Example of Subclassification",
    "text": "Example of Subclassification\n\nWe used subclassification when we compared the unconditional rates of new Covid-19 cases by face mask policy to the conditional rates new cases by policy regime in each month of our data.\n\nOverall rates are misleading.\nLots of things differ between January 2020 and January 2022\nSubclassification by month provides a “fairer” comparison\nBut is it “causal”\n\n\n\n\n\n- Even controlling for “month” there are other omitted variables: - Other policies in place? - Socio-economic differences between states - Others?\n\n\n\n\n- Trying to subclassify (stratify) comparisons on more than one or two variables gets hard - The Curse of Dimensionality\n\n\n## The Curse of Dimensionality\n\n\n- As we try to control for more factors, the number of observations per dimension declines rapidly - Men vs Women - Men, ages 20-30 vs Men ages 30-40 - Men, ages 20-30 with college degrees and blue eyes vs Men ages 20-30 with college degrees and green eyes\n\n\n- Subclassification with more than a few variables, will often produce a lack of common support: - Not enough observations to make credible counterfactual comparisons\n\n\n## Matching\n\n\n- Matching refers to a broad set of procedures that essentially try to generalize subclassification to - address to curse of dimensionality - achieve balance on a range of observable covariates between treated and control groups\n\n\n- Many different types of matching procedures:\n\n\n- Exact matching: Find exact matches between treatment and control observations for all covariates \\(X\\) - Coarsened exact matching: Find approximate matches within ranges of values for \\(X\\) - Distance-metric matching: Calculate a distance metric between observations based on their values of \\(X\\), and match treated and control to minimize that distance - Propensity score matching: Calculate the propsenity to receive treatment using \\(X\\) to predict \\(D\\) and treated and control based on their propensity scores\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=“center”} ::: {.cell-output-display}  ::: :::\n\n\nSource\n\n\n## Causal Identification with Matching (ICYI)\n\n\nMatching again requires an assumption of selection on observables\n\n\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\nY_i(1),Y_i(0) \\perp D_i |X_i && \\text{Selection on Observables}\\\\\n0 &lt; Pr(D_i = 1|X_i) &lt; 1  && \\text{Common Support}\n\\end{aligned}\\]\n\n\nMatching procedures like propensity score matching, allow us to match treated and control observations based on a propensity score, a predicted value of receiving the treatment, \\(D\\) based on observed variables, \\(X\\).\n\n\n\\[\np(X_i) = Pr(D=1|X_i) = \\pi_i\n\\]\n\n\nAllowing us to estimate an ATE conditional on \\(\\pi_i\\)\n\n\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\nATE &= E[Y_i(1)- Y_i(0)|p(X_i) = \\pi_i] \\\\\n&= E[Y_i(1)- Y_i(0)|p(X_i) = \\pi_i, D_i=1]\\\\\n& = E[Y_i |p(X_i) = \\pi_i, D_i=1] - E[Y_i |p(X_i) = \\pi_i, D_i=0]\n\\end{aligned}\\]\n\n\n## What to Know about Matching\n\n\n- The mechanics of matching are beyond the scope of this course\n\n\n- Just think of it as a generalization of subclassification when we want to condition on multiple variables\n\n\n- “Solves” the curse of dimensionality, creating Treatment-Control comparisons between groups that are similar on observed covariates\n\n\n- But no guarantee that matching produces balance on unobserved covariates.\n\n\n## Regression\n\n\n- We will spend the next two weeks talking in detail about regression, in general and linear regression in particular.\n\n\n- Today we’ll introduce some basic notation and simple examples\n\n\n- Conceptually, think of regression as - a tool to make predictions - by fitting lines to data\n\n\n- Theoretically, we will build towards an understanding of linear regression as a “linear estimate of the conditional expectation function \\((CEF = E[Y|X])\\)\n\n\n## Regression\n\n\nBroadly regression is a statistical procedural to help us model relationships that consists of:\n\n\n- \\(Y\\) an outcome variable or thing we’re trying to explain - AKA: The Dependent Variable, The Response Variable, The Lefthand side of the model\n\n\n- \\(X\\) a set of predictor variables or things we think explain variation in our outcome - AKA: The independent variable, covariates, the right hand side of the model.\n\n\n- \\(\\beta\\) a set of unknown parameters that describe the relationship between our outcome \\(Y\\) and our predictors \\(X\\)\n\n\n- \\(\\epsilon\\) the error term representing variation in \\(Y\\) not explained by our model.\n\n\n## Linear Regression\n\n\nNext week, we will start to consider simple (bivariate) linear regressions of the form:\n\n\n\\[\ny_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i + \\epsilon\n\\]\n\n\n- We call this a bivariate regression, because there are only two variables.\n\n\n- We call this a linear regression, because \\(y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i\\) is the equation for a line, where: - \\(\\beta_0\\) corresponds to the \\(y\\) intercept, or the model’s prediction when \\(x = 0\\). - \\(\\beta_1\\) corresponds to the slope, or how \\(y\\) is predicted to change as \\(x\\) changes.\n\n\n## Linear Regression\n\n\n- If you find this notation confusing, try plugging in substantive concepts for what \\(y\\) and \\(x\\) represent - Say we wanted to know how attitudes to transgender people varied with age in the baseline survey from Lab 03.\n\n\nThe generic linear model\n\n\n\\[y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i + \\epsilon\\]\n\n\nReflects:\n\n\n\\[\\text{Transgender Feeling Thermometer}_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1\\text{Age}_i + \\epsilon_i\\]\n\n\n## Estimating a Linear Regression\n\n\n- We estimate linear regressions in R using the lm() function. - lm() requires two arguments: - a formula of the general form y ~ x read as “Y modeled by X” or below “Transgender Feeling Thermometer’s modeled by Age - a data telling R\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=“center”}\n\n\n{.r .cell-code} load(url(\"https://pols1600.paultesta.org/files/data/03_lab.rda\")) :::\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=“center”}\n\n\n{.r .cell-code} m1 &lt;- lm(therm_trans_t0 ~ vf_age, data = df) m1\n\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n\n```\n\n\nCall: lm(formula = therm_trans_t0 ~ vf_age, data = df)\n\n\nCoefficients: (Intercept) vf_age 62.8196 -0.2031 ```\n\n\n::: :::\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=“center”} ::: {.cell-output-display}  ::: :::\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=“center”} ::: {.cell-output-display}  ::: :::\n\n\n## Multiple Regression\n\n\nIn two weeks, we will generalize this to include multiple predictors\n\n\n\\[y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{1i} + \\beta_2  x_{2i} + \\epsilon\\]\n\n\n- \\(\\beta_0\\) in this model still corresponds to the y intercept the model’s prediction when everything else is 0 - \\(\\beta_1\\) now describes the relationship between \\(x\\)\n\n\n\\[\\text{FT}_{Trans} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{Age}_{1i} + \\beta_2  \\text{Party ID}_{2i} + \\epsilon\\]\n\n\n## Multiple Regression with Matrix Notation\n\n\nWith more than two predictors, we will write equations using Matrix notation\n\n\n\\[y_i = X\\beta + \\epsilon\\]\n\n\n.pull-left[ Where X is a matrix of variables:\n\n\n\\[X=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1  & X_{1,1}&\\dots & X_{1,k}\\\\\n1  & X_{2,1}&\\dots & X_{2,k}\\\\\n\\vdots&\\vdots&  & \\vdots \\\\\n1  & X_{n,1}&\\dots & X_{n,k}\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\\] ] .pull-right[ And \\(\\beta\\) is a vector of coefficients\n\n\n\\[\\beta=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\beta_0\\\\\n\\beta_1\\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\n\\beta_k\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\\] ]\n\n\n## Causal Identification with Regression\n\n\nLike subclassification and matching, causal identification with Linear Regression requires us to believe the assumption of Selection on Observables\n\n\n\\[\nY_i(1),Y_i(0) \\perp D_i |X_i\n\\]\n\n\nAnd additionally asks us to make assumptions about the “functional form”:\n\n\n\\[\nY = \\beta_0 + \\tau D + X\\beta + \\epsilon\n\\]\n\n\n## Causal Identification with Regression\n\n\n- To interpret a linear regression’s estimate of \\(\\tau\\) as the causal effect of \\(D\\) on \\(Y\\), we need to believe we’ve got the right model\n\n\n- The only factors that predict both \\(Y\\) and \\(D\\) are those factors \\(X\\) which we control for in our model.\n\n\n- The relationship between \\(Y\\) and these predictors is linear\n\n\n\n\nWe almost never have the right model.\n\nDo we think age is the only factor that influences attitudes toward Trangendered folk? Probably not.\n\n\n–\n\nRegression is still a robust and useful tool\n\nWhy do we see negative relationship between age and transgender attitudes?\n\n\n–\n\nBut for causal inference, there’s nothing inherent about estimating a regression, or controlling for a lot of variables that makes for particularly credible causal claims."
