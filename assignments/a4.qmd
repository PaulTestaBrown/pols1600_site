You final will paper consists of seven sections. There is no minimum (or maximum) length for the final paper, but I've included rough estimates in parentheses of how long I think each section should be along with the relative contribution of each section to your final grade.

1. Introduction (5 percent, ~ 4 paragraphs)
2. Theory and Expectations (10 percent, ~4+ paragraphs)
3. Data (20 percent ~ 4+ paragraphs)
4. Design (25 percent ~ 5+ paragraphs)
5. Results (25 percent ~ 5+ paragraphs)
6. Conclusion (5 percent ~ 3+ paragraphs)
7. Appendix (10 percent ~ Variable codebook and all the R code for your project)

Specific guidance, expectations, and grading criteria for each section are provided below.

You need not have every section completely finished in this draft, but the more you have done the more feedback you will get. Remember, the data, design, and results section make up 70 percent of your grade, so while a good introduction, compelling theory, and thoughtful conclusion are important, you should budget your time accordingly.

Your actual grade for the draft will reflect a general assessment of the status of your project

- 100: On track for A
- 90: On track for A if provided specific tasks and changes are made
- 80: Lots of work to do, but if done, headed in the right direction
- 70: Major revisions needed. We should probably talk in office hours 

Additionally, I will assign points to each section as if it were you final paper to give you a sense of where to focus your efforts. This is not your actual grade for this assignment, but can be though of as a rough estimate of the grade you would receive on a section if you were to submit it, as is, for your final paper. Your grade for that section on the final paper may increase or decrease depending on the changes you make to your draft.


) and number of observations in your data

- Explain how your key concepts (outcome variable, key predictors, covariates/alternative explanations) are operationalized and measured

- Describe the distributions of these data using a table and/or figure(s). 

- Interpret these distributions for your reader. What does a typical observation in the data look like. Are some data skewed. Are their big outliers 

Your broader goals for this section are to convince your reader:

- That these data are appropriate for your research question

- Demonstrate your deep knowledge of these data through careful and thoughtful discussion of the measurement and distributions of your variables

- Set up your empirical results section through initial descriptive explorations of the data.

# Design 

Next, you will describe the empirical research design that you will use to test your expectations. You have two main tasks or goals for this section:

First you need to explain how you will to **test your theoretical expectations** in terms of the **empirical estimates of your model** (e.g. the regression coefficients of your linear models). 

Write down the equations of the models you are estimating. Based on the theoretical framework you've developed, what should we expect in terms of the sign, size, and significance of the predictors in your model?

At a minimum, you will likely want to specify at least two models:

1. A baseline (bivariate) model

$$Outcome = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times \text{Key Predictor} + \epsilon$$
And tell the reader what your theory implies the in terms of the sign, size, and statistical significance of the coefficient on your key predictor.

2. A multiple regression model controlling for alternative explanations (things that predict both your outcome and key predictor)


$$Outcome = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times \text{Key Predictor} + X\beta + \epsilon$$
Where $X\beta$ is a matrix containing one or more additional predictors representing alternative explanations. Again tell the reader how to interpret this model in relation to your baseline. If your theory is true, what should happen to sign, size, and significance of the coefficient(s) on your key predictor, once you've controlled for your alternative explanations?

Most of you will likely estimate more than two models. Perhaps your theory implies the relationship between your key predictor and the outcome is non-linear, or the depends on the value of other moderating variable. Again, specify this model, and explain to the reader how we should interpret 
 

Second, use this section to **demonstrate your mastery of some of the key statistical concepts** from the course. Specifically, you should do some of the following here:


- What are the identifying assumptions we would have to make for your research design to have a causal interpretation ? (e.g. Selection on observables?) What might violate these assumptions? How can you address these violations?
  
- If you're using linear regression, just what exactly is linear regression and why are you using it?
  
- How should we interpret the coefficients from a linear regression model?

- What does it mean to "control" for a variable in a regression?
   
- How can we quantify the uncertainty in our estimates? (What's a confidence interval? A sampling distribution? A standard error? What's a hypothesis test? A test statistic? A p-value?)
  
You will also get credit for demonstrating your understanding of these concepts through your interpretation of your results.

# Results

Having described your data and mapped your theoretical expectations onto your empirical models, you will present your results.

This section should include the following:

- A regression table (or tables) presenting the coefficients from estimated models

- Interpretation of the the coefficients from these models in terms of your empirical expectations. 
  - Are the results consistent with your expectations?
  - How and why do estimates vary from one model to the next?
  - How confident should we be in a given estimate? 
  - Specifically, how should we interpret the confidence intervals and p-values associated with a given estimate? 

- A figure that helps illustrate one of your key findings:
  - This will likely be a predicted values from one (or more) of your models, particularly if you are estimating a model with an interaction term, a polynomial term, or a generalized linear model.

In general, I would encourage you to start from the simplest, likely bivariate model. Use this as a chance to explain the mechanics of linear regression, the interpretation of linear regression as linear estimated of the Conditional Expectation Function, and demonstrate your mastery of the concepts of confidence intervals and hypothesis testing.

Then turn results from more complicated models. Again provide a substantive interpretation the coefficients and possible changes sign, size, and/or significance of coefficients from one model to the next. Use this discussion to further demonstrate your understanding of what it means to control for variables -- both from a technical and substantive perspective.

Finally use a figure (or figures) to help illustrate the substantive interpretation of your results. (e.g. How much is your outcome predicted to change if some key predictor moved from one standard deviation below its mean to one standard deviation above)

# Appendix 

Finally, at the end of your document, you should provide a:

- Codebook
- Code Appendix.

Your code book should describe be organized conceptually by variable type:

- Outcome
- Key Predictors
- Covariates

For each variable, provide:

- `variable_name_used_in_code` | Conceptual name
  - Description of variable/Survey Question Wording
  - Original name in raw data.
  - Summary of any recoding, transformations (e.g. Collapsing categories, or reverse coding endpoints of scales)
  - Summary of range of values (e.g. 1= Strong Democrat ... 7 = Strong Republican)

After you codebook, at the very end of you document, you will include a single code chunk that contains all the R code, used in your analysis. At a minimum, this code chunk should contain code that:

- Sets up the work space
- Loads your data
- Recodes and transforms the data as needed
- Produces tables of summary statistics and figures
- Estimate your models
- Presents the results of your models in tables and figures.

In the accompanying `POLS1600_paper_template.Rmd` I've demonstrated how to write your code inline with each section (e.g. loading data in the Data Section, estimating models in the Results section), display only the tables and figures you want in the main text, and then display the full code at the end of the document.

The keys to a nicely formatted document are:

- Setting global options for code chunks in the for `knitr`
- Labeling individual code chunks with meaninful names
- Setting `results ="asis"` for individual chunks you want to display in text.
- Setting `echo=T, eval=F` in the final appendix code chunk.
